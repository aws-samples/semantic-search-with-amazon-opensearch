    "item_1": " Item 1. Business ##TABLE_END\n\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents incorporated herein by reference contain forward-looking statements based on expectations, estimates, and projections as of the date of this filing. Actual results and outcomes may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. See Item 1A of Part I &#8212; &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; As used herein, &#8220;Amazon.com,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; and similar terms include Amazon.com, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise. \n\nGeneral \n\nWe seek to be Earth&#8217;s most customer-centric company. We are guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. In each of our segments, we serve our primary customer sets, consisting of consumers, sellers, developers, enterprises, content creators, advertisers, and employees. \n\nWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and Amazon Web Services (&#8220;AWS&#8221;). These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations. Information on our net sales is contained in Item 8 of Part II, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#8212; Note 10 &#8212; Segment Information.&#8221; \n\nConsumers \n\nWe serve consumers through our online and physical stores and focus on selection, price, and convenience. We design our stores to enable hundreds of millions of unique products to be sold by us and by third parties across dozens of product categories. Customers access our offerings through our websites, mobile apps, Alexa, devices, streaming, and physically visiting our stores. We also manufacture and sell electronic devices, including Kindle, Fire tablet, Fire TV, Echo, Ring, Blink, and eero, and we develop and produce media content. We seek to offer our customers low prices, fast and free delivery, easy-to-use functionality, and timely customer service. In addition, we offer subscription services such as Amazon Prime, a membership program that includes fast, free shipping on tens of millions of items, access to award-winning movies and series, and other benefits. \n\nWe fulfill customer orders in a number of ways, including through: North America and International fulfillment networks that we operate; co-sourced and outsourced arrangements in certain countries; digital delivery; and through our physical stores. We operate customer service centers globally, which are supplemented by co-sourced arrangements. See Item 2 of Part I, &#8220;Properties.&#8221; \n\nSellers \n\nWe offer programs that enable sellers to grow their businesses, sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders using our services. We are not the seller of record in these transactions. We earn fixed fees, a percentage of sales, per-unit activity fees, interest, or some combination thereof, for our seller programs. \n\nDevelopers and Enterprises \n\nWe serve developers and enterprises of all sizes, including start-ups, government agencies, and academic institutions, through AWS, which offers a broad set of on-demand technology services, including compute, storage, database, analytics, and machine learning, and other services. \n\nContent Creators \n\nWe offer programs that allow authors, independent publishers, musicians, filmmakers, Twitch streamers, skill and app developers, and others to publish and sell content. \n\nAdvertisers \n\nWe provide advertising services to sellers, vendors, publishers, authors, and others, through programs such as sponsored ads, display, and video advertising. \n\nCompetition \n\nOur businesses encompass a large variety of product types, service offerings, and delivery channels. The worldwide marketplace in which we compete is evolving rapidly and intensely competitive, and we face a broad array of competitors from many different industry sectors around the world. Our current and potential competitors include: (1) physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retailers, publishers, vendors, distributors, manufacturers, and producers of the products we offer and sell to consumers and businesses; (2) publishers, producers, and distributors of physical, digital, and interactive media of all types and all distribution channels; (3) web search engines, comparison shopping websites, social networks, web portals, and other online and app-based means of discovering, using, or acquiring goods and services, either directly or in collaboration with other retailers; (4) companies that provide e-commerce services, including website development and hosting, omnichannel sales, inventory and supply chain management, advertising, fulfillment, customer service, and payment processing; (5) companies that provide fulfillment and logistics services for themselves or for third parties, whether online or offline; (6) companies that provide information technology services or products, including on-premises or cloud-based infrastructure and other services; (7) companies that design, manufacture, market, or sell consumer electronics, telecommunication, and electronic devices; (8) companies that sell grocery products online and in physical stores; and (9) companies that provide advertising services, whether in digital or other formats. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our retail businesses include selection, price, and convenience, including fast and reliable fulfillment. Additional competitive factors for our seller and enterprise services include the quality, speed, and reliability of our services and tools, as well as customers&#8217; ability and willingness to change business practices. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories, more customers, greater brand recognition, and greater control over inputs critical to our various businesses. They may secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing, pursue restrictive distribution agreements that restrict our access to supply, direct consumers to their own offerings instead of ours, lock-in potential customers with restrictive terms, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing. The internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, which enhances the ability of new, smaller, or lesser-known businesses to compete against us. Each of our businesses is also subject to rapid change and the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors. Other companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions. \n\nIntellectual Property \n\nWe regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, partners, and others to protect our proprietary rights. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. and international domain names, trademarks, service marks, and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain of our proprietary technology. \n\nSeasonality \n\nOur business is affected by seasonality, which historically has resulted in higher sales volume during our fourth quarter, which ends December 31. \n\nHuman Capital \n\nOur employees are critical to our mission of being Earth&#8217;s most customer-centric company. As of December 31, 2023, we employed approximately 1,525,000 full-time and part-time employees. Additionally, we use independent contractors and temporary personnel to supplement our workforce. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, particularly for software engineers, computer scientists, and other technical staff, and constrained labor markets have increased competition for personnel across other parts of our business. \n\nAs we strive to be Earth&#8217;s best employer, we focus on investment and innovation, inclusion and diversity, safety, and engagement to hire and develop the best talent. We rely on numerous and evolving initiatives to implement these objectives and invent mechanisms for talent development, including competitive pay and benefits, flexible work arrangements, and skills training and educational programs such as Amazon Career Choice (education funding for eligible employees) and the Amazon Technical Academy (software development engineer training). Over 175,000 Amazon employees around the world have participated in Career Choice. We also continue to inspect and refine the mechanisms we use to hire, develop, evaluate, and retain our employees to promote equity for all candidates and employees. In addition, safety is integral to everything we do at Amazon and we continue to invest in safety improvements such as capital improvements, new safety technology, vehicle safety controls, and engineering ergonomic solutions. Our safety team is dedicated to using the science of safety to solve complex problems and establish new industry best practices. We also provide mentorship and support resources to our employees, and have deployed numerous programs that advance employee engagement, communication, and feedback. \n\nAvailable Information \n\nOur investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly make available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;), corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases. \n\nExecutive Officers and Directors \n\nThe following tables set forth certain information regarding our Executive Officers and Directors as of January 24, 2024: \n\nInformation About Our Executive Officers \n\n##TABLE_START Name Age Position Jeffrey P.

    "item_1A": " Item 1A. Risk Factors ##TABLE_END\n\nPlease carefully consider the following discussion of significant factors, events, and uncertainties that make an investment in our securities risky. The events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could, in circumstances we may or may not be able to accurately predict, recognize, or control, have a material adverse effect on our business, growth, reputation, prospects, financial condition, operating results (including components of our financial results), cash flows, liquidity, and stock price. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by factors, events, or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations. In addition to the factors discussed in Item 7 of Part II, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,&#8221; and in the risk factors below, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of the risks discussed below. Many of the risks discussed below also impact our customers, including third-party sellers, which could indirectly have a material adverse effect on us. \n\nBusiness and Industry Risks \n\nWe Face Intense Competition \n\nOur businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and we have many competitors across geographies, including cross-border competition, and in different industries, including physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, e-commerce services, web and infrastructure computing services, electronic devices, digital content, advertising, grocery, and transportation and logistics services. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories, more customers, and/or greater brand recognition, particularly with our newly-launched products and services and in our newer geographic regions. They may secure better terms from vendors, adopt more aggressive pricing, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing. \n\nCompetition continues to intensify, including with the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors, and as our competitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with our business. In addition, new and enhanced technologies, including search, web and infrastructure computing services, practical applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning, digital content, and electronic devices continue to increase our competition. The internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, which enhances the ability of new, smaller, or lesser known businesses to compete against us. As a result of competition, our product and service offerings may not be successful, we may fail to gain or may lose business, and we may be required to increase our spending or lower prices, any of which could materially reduce our sales and profits. \n\nOur Expansion into New Products, Services, Technologies, and Geographic Regions Subjects Us to Additional Risks \n\nWe may have limited or no experience in our newer market segments, and our customers may not adopt our product or service offerings. These offerings, which can present new and difficult technology challenges, may subject us to claims if customers of these offerings experience, or are otherwise impacted by, service disruptions, delays, setbacks, or failures or quality issues. In addition, profitability or other intended benefits, if any, in our newer activities may not meet our expectations, and we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them, which investments are often significant. Failure to realize the benefits of amounts we invest in new technologies, products, or services could result in the \n\nvalue of those investments being written down or written off. In addition, our sustainability initiatives may be unsuccessful for a variety of reasons, including if we are unable to realize the expected benefits of new technologies or if we do not successfully plan or execute new strategies, which could harm our business or damage our reputation. \n\nOur International Operations Expose Us to a Number of Risks \n\nOur international activities are significant to our revenues and profits, and we plan to further expand internationally. In certain international market segments, we have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any first-to-market advantages or otherwise succeed. It is costly to establish, develop, and maintain international operations and stores, and promote our brand internationally. Our international operations may not become profitable on a sustained basis. \n\nIn addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including: \n\n&#8226; local economic and political conditions; \n\n&#8226; government regulation (such as regulation of our product and service offerings and of competition); restrictive governmental actions (such as trade protection measures, including export duties and quotas and custom duties and tariffs, and restrictions around the import and export of certain products, technologies, and components); nationalization; and restrictions on foreign ownership; \n\n&#8226; restrictions on sales or distribution of certain products or services and uncertainty regarding liability for products, services, and content, including uncertainty as a result of less internet-friendly legal systems, local laws, lack of legal precedent, and varying rules, regulations, and practices regarding the physical and digital distribution of media products and enforcement of intellectual property rights; \n\n&#8226; business licensing or certification requirements, such as for imports, exports, web services, and electronic devices; \n\n&#8226; limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions; \n\n&#8226; limited fulfillment and technology infrastructure; \n\n&#8226; shorter payable and longer receivable cycles and the resultant negative impact on cash flow; \n\n&#8226; laws and regulations regarding privacy, data use, data protection, data security, data localization, network security, consumer protection, payments, advertising, and restrictions on pricing or discounts; \n\n&#8226; lower levels of use of the internet; \n\n&#8226; lower levels of consumer spending and fewer opportunities for growth compared to the U.S.; \n\n&#8226; lower levels of credit card usage and increased payment risk; \n\n&#8226; difficulty in staffing, developing, and managing foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences; \n\n&#8226; different employee/employer relationships and the existence of works councils and labor unions; \n\n&#8226; compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable U.S. and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials and other third parties; \n\n&#8226; laws and policies of the U.S. and other jurisdictions affecting trade, foreign investment, loans, and taxes; and \n\n&#8226; geopolitical events, including war and terrorism. \n\nAs international physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, cloud services, and other services grow, competition will intensify, including through adoption of evolving business models. Local companies may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of, and focus on, the local customer, as well as their more established local brand names. The inability to hire, train, retain, and manage sufficient required personnel may limit our international growth. \n\nThe People&#8217;s Republic of China (&#8220;PRC&#8221;) and India regulate Amazon&#8217;s and its affiliates&#8217; businesses and operations in country through regulations and license requirements that may restrict (i) foreign investment in and operation of the internet, IT infrastructure, data centers, retail, delivery, and other sectors, (ii) internet content, and (iii) the sale of media and other products and services. For example, in order to meet local ownership, regulatory licensing, and cybersecurity requirements, we provide certain technology services in China through contractual relationships with third parties that hold PRC licenses to provide services. In India, the government restricts the ownership or control of Indian companies by foreign entities involved in online multi-brand retail trading activities. For www.amazon.in, we provide certain marketing tools and logistics services to third-party sellers to enable them to sell online and deliver to customers, and we hold an indirect minority interest in an entity that is a third-party seller on the www.amazon.in marketplace. Although we believe these structures and activities comply with existing laws, they involve unique risks, and the PRC and India may from time to time consider and implement additional changes in \n\ntheir regulatory, licensing, or other requirements that could impact these structures and activities. There are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation of PRC and Indian laws and regulations, and it is possible that these governments will ultimately take a view contrary to ours. In addition, our Chinese and Indian businesses and operations may be unable to continue to operate if we or our affiliates are unable to access sufficient funding or, in China, enforce contractual relationships we or our affiliates have in place. Violation of any existing or future PRC, Indian, or other laws or regulations or changes in the interpretations of those laws and regulations could result in our businesses in those countries being subject to fines and other financial penalties, having licenses revoked, or being forced to restructure our operations or shut down entirely. \n\nIn addition, because China-based sellers account for significant portions of our third-party seller services and advertising revenues, and China-based suppliers provide significant portions of our components and finished goods, regulatory and trade restrictions, data protection and cybersecurity laws, economic factors, geopolitical events, security issues, or other factors negatively impacting China-based sellers and suppliers could adversely affect our operating results. \n\nThe Variability in Our Retail Business Places Increased Strain on Our Operations \n\nDemand for our products and services can fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including as a result of seasonality, promotions, product launches, or unforeseeable events, such as in response to global economic conditions such as recessionary fears or rising inflation, natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises) or extreme weather (including as a result of climate change), or geopolitical events. For example, we expect a disproportionate amount of our retail sales to occur during our fourth quarter. Our failure to stock or restock popular products in sufficient amounts such that we fail to meet customer demand could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth. When we overstock products, we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or write-offs and incur commitment costs, which could materially reduce profitability. We regularly experience increases in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrades, split-shipments, and additional long-zone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season. If too many customers access our websites within a short period of time due to increased demand, we may experience system interruptions that make our websites unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders, which may reduce the volume of goods we offer or sell and the attractiveness of our products and services. In addition, we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other fulfillment companies and customer service co-sourcers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand. Risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A relating to fulfillment network optimization and inventory are magnified during periods of high demand. \n\nAs a result of holiday sales, as of December 31 of each year, our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances typically reach their highest level (other than as a result of cash flows provided by or used in investing and financing activities) because consumers primarily use credit cards in our stores and the related receivables settle quickly. Typically, there is also a corresponding increase in accounts payable as of December 31 due to inventory purchases and third-party seller sales. Our accounts payable balance generally declines during the first three months of the year as vendors and sellers are paid, resulting in a corresponding decline in our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances. \n\nWe Are Impacted by Fraudulent or Unlawful Activities of Sellers \n\nThe law relating to the liability of online service providers is currently unsettled. In addition, governmental agencies have in the past and could in the future require changes in the way this business is conducted. Under our seller programs, we maintain policies and processes designed to prevent sellers from collecting payments, fraudulently or otherwise, when buyers never receive the products they ordered or when the products received are materially different from the sellers&#8217; descriptions, and to prevent sellers in our stores or through other stores from selling unlawful, counterfeit, pirated, or stolen goods, selling goods in an unlawful or unethical manner, violating the proprietary rights of others, or otherwise violating our policies. When these policies and processes are circumvented or fail to operate sufficiently, it can harm our business or damage our reputation and we could face civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities by our sellers. Under our A-to-z Guarantee, we may reimburse customers for payments up to certain limits in these situations, and as our third-party seller sales grow, the cost of this program will increase and could negatively affect our operating results. \n\nWe Face Risks Related to Adequately Protecting Our Intellectual Property Rights and Being Accused of Infringing Intellectual Property Rights of Third Parties \n\nWe regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technology, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, and others to protect our proprietary rights. Effective intellectual property protection is not available in every country in which our products and services are made available. We also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business. Furthermore, regulations governing domain names may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights. We may be \n\nunable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon, or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights. \n\nWe are not always able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights. Actions taken by third parties that license our proprietary rights may materially diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation. The protection of our intellectual property requires the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. Moreover, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property do not always adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights. We also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property rights. \n\nWe have been subject to, and expect to continue to be subject to, claims and legal proceedings regarding alleged infringement by us of the intellectual property rights of third parties. Such claims, whether or not meritorious, have in the past, and may in the future, result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources, injunctions against us, or significant payments for damages, including to satisfy indemnification obligations or to obtain licenses from third parties who allege that we have infringed their rights. Such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. These risks have been amplified by the increase in third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims. In addition, our and our customers&#8217; use of artificial intelligence may result in increased claims of infringement or other claims, including those based on unauthorized use of third-party technology or content. \n\nOur digital content offerings depend in part on effective digital rights management technology to control access to digital content. Breach or malfunctioning of the digital rights management technology that we use could subject us to claims, and content providers may be unwilling to include their content in our service. \n\nWe Have Foreign Exchange Risk \n\nThe results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our international stores and product and service offerings are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Due to these fluctuations, operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. As we have expanded our international operations, our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased. We also hold cash equivalents and/or marketable securities in foreign currencies such as British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Euros, and Japanese Yen. When the U.S. Dollar strengthens compared to these currencies, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, when translated, may be materially less than expected and vice versa. \n\nOperating Risks \n\nOur Expansion Places a Significant Strain on our Management, Operational, Financial, and Other Resources \n\nWe are continuing to rapidly and significantly expand our global operations, including increasing our product and service offerings and scaling our infrastructure to support our retail and services businesses. The complexity of the current scale of our business can place significant strain on our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions, and our expansion increases these factors. Failure to manage growth effectively could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results. \n\nWe Experience Significant Fluctuations in Our Operating Results and Growth Rate \n\nWe are not always able to accurately forecast our growth rate. We base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates. A significant portion of our expenses and investments is fixed, and we are not always able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected. \n\nOur revenue growth may not be sustainable, and our percentage growth rates may decrease. Our revenue and operating profit growth depends on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us or our sellers, and our business is affected by, among other things, general economic, business, and geopolitical conditions worldwide. A softening of demand, whether caused by changes in customer preferences or a weakening of the U.S. or global economies, may result in decreased revenue or growth. \n\nOur sales and operating results will also fluctuate for many other reasons, including due to factors described elsewhere in this section and the following: \n\n&#8226; our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers, and satisfy our customers&#8217; demands; \n\n&#8226; our ability to retain and expand our network of sellers; \n\n&#8226; our ability to offer products on favorable terms, manage inventory, and fulfill orders; \n\n&#8226; the introduction of competitive stores, websites, products, services, price decreases, or improvements; \n\n&#8226; changes in usage or adoption rates of the internet, e-commerce, electronic devices, and web services, including outside the U.S.; \n\n&#8226; timing, effectiveness, and costs of expansion and upgrades of our systems and infrastructure; \n\n&#8226; the success of our geographic, service, and product line expansions; \n\n&#8226; the extent to which we finance, and the terms of any such financing for, our current operations and future growth; \n\n&#8226; the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, which may include significant monetary damages or injunctive relief and could have a material adverse impact on our operating results; \n\n&#8226; variations in the mix of products and services we sell; \n\n&#8226; variations in our level of merchandise and vendor returns; \n\n&#8226; the extent to which we offer fast and free delivery, continue to reduce prices worldwide, and provide additional benefits to our customers; \n\n&#8226; factors affecting our reputation or brand image (including any actual or perceived inability to achieve our goals or commitments, whether related to sustainability, customers, employees, or other topics), and public perceptions regarding social or ethical issues related to our development and use of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies, products, and services; \n\n&#8226; the extent to which we invest in technology and infrastructure, fulfillment, and other expense categories; \n\n&#8226; availability of and increases in the prices of transportation (including fuel), resources such as land, water, and energy, commodities like paper and packing supplies and hardware products, and technology infrastructure products, including as a result of inflationary pressures; \n\n&#8226; constrained labor markets, which increase our payroll costs; \n\n&#8226; the extent to which operators of the networks between our customers and our stores successfully charge fees to grant our customers unimpaired and unconstrained access to our online services; \n\n&#8226; our ability to collect amounts owed to us when they become due; \n\n&#8226; the extent to which new and existing technologies, or industry trends, restrict online advertising or affect our ability to customize advertising or otherwise tailor our product and service offerings; \n\n&#8226; the extent to which use of our services is affected by spyware, viruses, phishing and other spam emails, denial of service attacks, data theft, computer intrusions, outages, and similar events; \n\n&#8226; the extent to which we fail to maintain our unique culture of innovation, customer obsession, and long-term thinking, which has been critical to our growth and success; \n\n&#8226; disruptions from natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises) or extreme weather (including as a result of climate change), geopolitical events and security issues (including terrorist attacks, armed hostilities, and political conflicts, including those involving China), labor or trade disputes (including restrictive governmental actions impacting us, our customers, and our third-party sellers and suppliers in China or other foreign countries), and similar events; and \n\n&#8226; potential negative impacts of climate change, including: increased operating costs due to more frequent extreme weather events or climate-related changes, such as rising temperatures and water scarcity; increased investment requirements associated with the transition to a low-carbon economy; decreased demand for our products and services as a result of changes in customer behavior; increased compliance costs due to more extensive and global regulations and third-party requirements; and reputational damage resulting from perceptions of our environmental impact. \n\nWe Face Risks Related to Successfully Optimizing and Operating Our Fulfillment Network and Data Centers \n\nFailures to adequately predict customer demand and consumer spending patterns or otherwise optimize and operate our fulfillment network and data centers successfully from time to time result in excess or insufficient fulfillment or data center capacity, service interruptions, increased costs, and impairment charges, any of which could materially harm our business. As we continue to add fulfillment and data center capability or add new businesses with different requirements, our fulfillment and data center networks become increasingly complex and operating them becomes more challenging. There can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our networks effectively. \n\nIn addition, failure to optimize inventory management or staffing in our fulfillment network increases our net shipping cost by increasing the distance products are shipped and reducing the number of units per shipment or delivery. We and our co-sourcers may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers. For example, productivity across our fulfillment network is affected by regional labor market constraints, which increase payroll costs and make it difficult to hire, train, and deploy a sufficient number of people to operate our fulfillment network as efficiently as we would like. \n\nUnder some of our commercial agreements, we maintain the inventory of other companies, thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory and operating our fulfillment network. Our failure to adequately predict seller demand for storage or to properly handle such inventory or the inability of the other businesses on whose behalf we perform inventory fulfillment services to accurately forecast product demand may result in us being unable to secure sufficient storage space or to optimize our fulfillment network or cause other unexpected costs and other harm to our business and reputation. \n\nWe rely on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and completed orders to our customers. An inability to negotiate acceptable terms with these companies or performance problems, staffing limitations, or other difficulties experienced by these companies or by our own transportation systems, including as a result of labor market constraints and related costs, could negatively impact our operating results and customer experience. In addition, our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship completed orders to customers also may be negatively affected by natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises) or extreme weather (including as a result of climate change), geopolitical events and security issues, labor or trade disputes, and similar events. \n\nWe Could Be Harmed by Data Loss or Other Security Breaches \n\nBecause we collect, process, store, and transmit large amounts of data, including confidential, classified, sensitive, proprietary, and business and personal information, failure to prevent or mitigate data loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized access, or other security breaches or vulnerabilities affecting our or our vendors&#8217; or customers&#8217; technology, products, and systems, could: expose us or our customers to a risk of loss, disclosure, or misuse of such information; adversely affect our operating results; result in litigation, liability, or regulatory action (including under laws related to privacy, data use, data protection, data security, network security, and consumer protection); deter customers or sellers from using our stores, products, and services; and otherwise harm our business and reputation. We use third-party technology and systems for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, encryption and authentication technology, employee email, content delivery to customers, back-office support, and other functions. Some of our systems have experienced past security breaches, and, although they did not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, there can be no assurance that future incidents will not have material adverse effects on our operations or financial results. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer data and prevent such incidents, including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a third-party vendor or customer, such measures cannot provide absolute security and may fail to operate as intended or be circumvented. \n\nWe Face Risks Related to System Interruption and Lack of Redundancy \n\nWe experience occasional system interruptions and delays that make our websites and services unavailable or slow to respond and prevent us from efficiently accepting or fulfilling orders or providing services to customers and third parties, which may reduce our net sales and the attractiveness of our products and services. Steps we take to add software and hardware, upgrade our systems and network infrastructure, and improve the stability and efficiency of our systems may not be sufficient to avoid system interruptions or delays that could adversely affect our operating results. \n\nOur computer and communications systems and operations in the past have been, or in the future could be, damaged or interrupted due to events such as natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises) or extreme weather (including as a result of climate change), geopolitical events and security issues (including terrorist attacks and armed hostilities), computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, operational failures (including from energy shortages), and similar events or disruptions. Any of these events could cause system interruption, delays, and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders and providing services, which could make our product and service offerings less attractive and subject us to liability. Our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient. In addition, our insurance may not provide sufficient coverage to compensate for related losses. Any of these events could damage our reputation and be expensive to remedy. \n\nThe Loss of Key Senior Management Personnel or the Failure to Hire and Retain Highly Skilled and Other Personnel Could Negatively Affect Our Business \n\nWe depend on our senior management and other key personnel, including our President and CEO. We do not have &#8220;key person&#8221; life insurance policies. We also rely on other highly skilled personnel. Competition for qualified personnel in the industries in which we operate, as well as senior management, has historically been intense. For example, we experience \n\nsignificant competition in the technology industry, particularly for software engineers, computer scientists, and other technical staff. In addition, changes we make to our current and future work environments may not meet the needs or expectations of our employees or may be perceived as less favorable compared to other companies&#8217; policies, which could negatively impact our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel. The loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees, the failure to successfully transition key roles, or the inability to hire, train, retain, and manage qualified personnel, could harm our business. \n\nWe also rely on a significant number of personnel to operate our stores, fulfillment network, and data centers and carry out our other operations. Failure to successfully hire, train, manage, and retain sufficient personnel to meet our needs can strain our operations, increase payroll and other costs, and harm our business and reputation. In addition, changes in laws and regulations applicable to employees, independent contractors, and temporary personnel could increase our payroll costs, decrease our operational flexibility, and negatively impact how we are able to staff our operations and supplement our workforce. \n\nWe are also subject to labor union efforts to organize groups of our employees from time to time. These organizational efforts, if successful, decrease our operational flexibility, which could adversely affect our operating efficiency. In addition, our response to any organizational efforts could be perceived negatively and harm our business and reputation. \n\nOur Supplier Relationships Subject Us to a Number of Risks \n\nWe have significant suppliers, including content and technology licensors, and in some cases, limited or single-sources of supply, that are important to our sourcing, services, manufacturing, and any related ongoing servicing of merchandise and content. We do not have long-term arrangements with most of our suppliers to guarantee availability of merchandise, content, components, or services, particular payment terms, or the extension of credit limits. Decisions by our current suppliers to limit or stop selling or licensing merchandise, content, components, or services to us on acceptable terms, or delay delivery, including as a result of one or more supplier bankruptcies due to poor economic conditions, as a result of natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises) or geopolitical events, or for other reasons, may result in our being unable to procure alternatives from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all. For example, we rely on a limited group of suppliers for semiconductor products, including products related to artificial intelligence infrastructure such as graphics processing units. Constraints on the availability of these products could adversely affect our ability to develop and operate artificial intelligence technologies, products, or services. In addition, violations by our suppliers or other vendors of applicable laws, regulations, contractual terms, intellectual property rights of others, or our Supply Chain Standards, as well as products or practices regarded as unethical, unsafe, or hazardous, could expose us to claims, damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results. \n\nOur Commercial Agreements, Strategic Alliances, and Other Business Relationships Expose Us to Risks \n\nWe provide physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, cloud services, and other services to businesses through commercial agreements, strategic alliances, and business relationships. Under these agreements, we provide web services, technology, fulfillment, computing, digital storage, and other services, as well as enable sellers to offer products or services through our stores. These arrangements are complex and require substantial infrastructure capacity, personnel, and other resource commitments, which may limit the amount of business we can service. We may not be able to implement, maintain, and develop the components of these commercial relationships, which may include web services, fulfillment, customer service, inventory management, tax collection, payment processing, hardware, content, and third-party software, and engaging third parties to perform services. The amount of compensation we receive under certain of our commercial agreements is partially dependent on the volume of the other company&#8217;s sales. Therefore, when the other company&#8217;s offerings are not successful, the compensation we receive may be lower than expected or the agreement may be terminated. Moreover, we may not be able to enter into additional or alternative commercial relationships and strategic alliances on favorable terms. We also may be subject to claims from businesses to which we provide these services if we are unsuccessful in implementing, maintaining, or developing these services. \n\nAs our agreements terminate, we may be unable to renew or replace these agreements on comparable terms, or at all. We may in the future enter into amendments on less favorable terms or encounter parties that have difficulty meeting their contractual obligations to us, which could adversely affect our operating results. \n\nOur present and future commercial agreements, strategic alliances, and business relationships create additional risks such as: \n\n&#8226; disruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses; \n\n&#8226; impairment of other relationships; \n\n&#8226; variability in revenue and income from entering into, amending, or terminating such agreements or relationships; and \n\n&#8226; difficulty integrating under the commercial agreements. \n\nOur Business Suffers When We Are Unsuccessful in Making, Integrating, and Maintaining Acquisitions and Investments \n\nWe have acquired and invested in a number of companies, and we may in the future acquire or invest in or enter into joint ventures with additional companies. These transactions involve risks such as: \n\n&#8226; disruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses; \n\n&#8226; problems retaining key personnel; \n\n&#8226; additional operating losses and expenses of the businesses we acquired or in which we invested; \n\n&#8226; the potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets and goodwill, including as a result of acquisitions; \n\n&#8226; the potential impairment of customer and other relationships of the company we acquired or in which we invested or our own customers as a result of any integration of operations; \n\n&#8226; the difficulty of completing such transactions, including obtaining regulatory approvals or satisfying other closing conditions, and achieving anticipated benefits within expected timeframes, or at all; \n\n&#8226; the difficulty of incorporating acquired operations, technology, and rights into our offerings, and unanticipated expenses related to such integration; \n\n&#8226; the difficulty of integrating a new company&#8217;s accounting, financial reporting, management, information and data security, human resource, and other administrative systems to permit effective management, and the lack of control if such integration is delayed or not successfully implemented; \n\n&#8226; losses we may incur as a result of declines in the value of an investment or as a result of incorporating an investee&#8217;s financial performance into our financial results; \n\n&#8226; for investments in which an investee&#8217;s financial performance is incorporated into our financial results, either in full or in part, or investments for which we are required to file financial statements or provide financial information, the dependence on the investee&#8217;s accounting, financial reporting, and similar systems, controls, and processes; \n\n&#8226; the difficulty of implementing at companies we acquire the controls, procedures, and policies appropriate for a larger public company; \n\n&#8226; the risks associated with businesses we acquire or invest in, which may differ from or be more significant than the risks our other businesses face; \n\n&#8226; potential unknown liabilities associated with a company we acquire or in which we invest; and \n\n&#8226; for foreign transactions, additional risks related to the integration of operations across different cultures and languages, and the economic, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries. \n\nAs a result of future acquisitions or mergers, we might need to issue additional equity securities, spend our cash, or incur debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses related to intangible assets, any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business or only be available on unfavorable terms, if at all. In addition, valuations supporting our acquisitions and strategic investments could change rapidly. We could determine that such valuations have experienced impairments or other-than-temporary declines in fair value which could adversely impact our financial results. \n\nWe Face Significant Inventory Risk \n\nIn addition to risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A relating to fulfillment network and inventory optimization by us and third parties, we are exposed to significant inventory risks that may adversely affect our operating results as a result of seasonality, new product launches, rapid changes in product cycles and pricing, defective merchandise, changes in customer demand and consumer spending patterns, changes in consumer tastes with respect to our products, spoilage, and other factors. We endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products we manufacture and/or sell. Demand for products, however, can change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale. In addition, when we begin selling or manufacturing a new product or offering a new service, it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships, determine appropriate product or component selection, and accurately forecast demand. The acquisition of certain types of inventory or components requires significant lead-time and prepayment and they may not be returnable. We carry a broad selection and significant inventory levels of certain products, such as consumer electronics, and at times we are unable to sell products in sufficient quantities or to meet demand during the relevant selling seasons. Any one of the inventory risk factors set forth above may adversely affect our operating results. \n\nWe Are Subject to Payments-Related Risks \n\nWe accept payments using a variety of methods, including credit card, debit card, credit accounts (including promotional financing), gift cards, direct debit from a customer&#8217;s bank account, consumer invoicing, physical bank check, and payment \n\nupon delivery. For existing and future payment options we offer to our customers, we currently are subject to, and may become subject to additional, regulations and compliance requirements (including obligations to implement enhanced authentication processes that could result in significant costs and reduce the ease of use of our payments products), as well as fraud. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability. We rely on third parties to provide certain Amazon-branded payment methods and payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, electronic checks, and promotional financing. In each case, it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. We also offer co-branded credit card programs, which could adversely affect our operating results if renewed on less favorable terms or terminated. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. Failure to comply with these rules or requirements, as well as any breach, compromise, or failure to otherwise detect or prevent fraudulent activity involving our data security systems, could result in our being liable for card issuing banks&#8217; costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees, and loss of our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers, process electronic funds transfers, or facilitate other types of online payments, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. \n\nIn addition, we provide regulated services in certain jurisdictions because we enable customers to keep account balances with us and transfer money to third parties, and because we provide services to third parties to facilitate payments on their behalf. Jurisdictions subject us to requirements for licensing, regulatory inspection, bonding and capital maintenance, the use, handling, and segregation of transferred funds, consumer disclosures, maintaining or processing data, and authentication. We are also subject to or voluntarily comply with a number of other laws and regulations relating to payments, money laundering, international money transfers, privacy, data use, data protection, data security, data localization, network security, consumer protection, and electronic fund transfers. If we were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to additional requirements and civil and criminal penalties, or forced to cease providing certain services. \n\nWe Have a Rapidly Evolving Business Model and Our Stock Price Is Highly Volatile \n\nWe have a rapidly evolving business model. The trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly in response to, among other risks, the risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A, as well as: \n\n&#8226; changes in interest rates; \n\n&#8226; conditions or trends in the internet and the industry segments we operate in; \n\n&#8226; quarterly variations in operating results; \n\n&#8226; fluctuations in the stock market in general and market prices for internet-related companies in particular; \n\n&#8226; changes in financial estimates by us or decisions to increase or decrease future spending or investment levels; \n\n&#8226; changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts; \n\n&#8226; changes in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public; \n\n&#8226; changes in the valuation methodology of, or performance by, other e-commerce or technology companies; and \n\n&#8226; transactions in our common stock by major investors and certain analyst reports, news, and speculation. \n\nVolatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities and force us to increase our cash compensation to employees or grant larger stock awards than we have historically, which could hurt our operating results or reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders, or both. \n\nLegal and Regulatory Risks \n\nGovernment Regulation Is Evolving and Unfavorable Changes Could Harm Our Business \n\nWe are subject to general business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the internet, physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, digital content, web services, electronic devices, advertising, artificial intelligence technologies and services, and other products and services that we offer or sell. These regulations and laws cover taxation, privacy, data use, data protection, data security, data localization, network security, consumer protection, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, transportation, mobile communications, electronic device certification, electronic waste, energy consumption, environmental and climate-related regulation, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, employment, trade and protectionist measures, web services, the provision of online payment services, registration, licensing, and information reporting requirements, unencumbered internet access to our services or access to our facilities, the design and operation of websites, health, safety, and sanitation standards, the characteristics, legality, and quality of products and services, product labeling, the commercial operation of unmanned aircraft systems, healthcare, and other matters. It is not clear how \n\nexisting laws governing issues such as property ownership, libel, privacy, data use, data protection, data security, data localization, network security, and consumer protection apply to aspects of our operations such as the internet, e-commerce, digital content, web services, electronic devices, advertising, and artificial intelligence technologies and services. A large number of jurisdictions regulate our operations, and the extent, nature, and scope of such regulations is evolving and expanding as the scope of our businesses expand. We are regularly subject to formal and informal reviews, investigations, and other proceedings by governments and regulatory authorities under existing laws, regulations, or interpretations or pursuing new and novel approaches to regulate our operations. For example, we face a number of open investigations based on claims that aspects of our operations infringe competition rules, including aspects of Amazon&#8217;s operation of its stores including its fulfillment network, Amazon&#8217;s acquisitions, and certain aspects of AWS&#8217;s offering of cloud services. We strongly dispute these claims and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these investigations. Similarly, we face investigations under a growing patchwork of laws and regulations governing the collection, use, and disclosure of data, the interpretation of which continues to evolve, leading to uncertainty about how regulators will view our privacy practices. In addition, regulators and lawmakers are increasingly focused on controlling additional aspects of the operations of technology companies and companies they have characterized to be online &#8220;gatekeepers&#8221; through the application of existing regulations and laws and the adoption of new regulations and laws, which increases our compliance costs and limits the operation of our business. Unfavorable regulations, laws, decisions, or interpretations by government or regulatory authorities applying those laws and regulations, or inquiries, investigations, or enforcement actions threatened or initiated by them, could cause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties (including substantial monetary fines), diminish the demand for, or availability of, our products and services, increase our cost of doing business, require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business, damage our reputation, impede our growth, or otherwise have a material effect on our operations. The media, political, and regulatory scrutiny we face, which may continue to increase, amplifies these risks. \n\nClaims, Litigation, Government Investigations, and Other Proceedings May Adversely Affect Our Business and Results of Operations \n\nAs an innovative company offering a wide range of consumer and business products and services around the world, we are regularly subject to actual and threatened claims, litigation, reviews, investigations, and other proceedings, including proceedings by governments and regulatory authorities, involving a wide range of issues, including patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment (including the characterization of delivery drivers), competition and antitrust, privacy, data use, data protection, data security, data localization, network security, consumer protection, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third parties (including artificial intelligence technologies and services), and other matters. The number and scale of these proceedings have increased over time as our businesses have expanded in scope and geographic reach, as our products, services, and operations have become more complex and available to, and used by, more people, and as governments and regulatory authorities seek to regulate us on a pre-emptive basis. For example, we are litigating a number of matters alleging price fixing, monopolization, and consumer protection claims, including those brought by state attorneys general and the Federal Trade Commission. Any of these types of proceedings can have an adverse effect on us because of legal costs, disruption of our operations, diversion of management resources, negative publicity, and other factors. The outcomes of these matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. Determining legal reserves or possible losses from such matters involves judgment and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable outcomes. Until the final resolution of such matters, we may be exposed to losses in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material. Should any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In addition, it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings, including as a result of a settlement, could involve licenses, sanctions, consent decrees, or orders requiring us to make substantial future payments, preventing us from offering certain products or services, requiring us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business, requiring development of non-infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies, damaging our reputation, or otherwise having a material effect on our operations. \n\nWe Are Subject to Product Liability Claims When People or Property Are Harmed by the Products We Sell or Manufacture \n\nSome of the products we sell or manufacture expose us to product liability or food safety claims relating to personal injury or illness, death, or environmental or property damage, and can require product recalls or other actions. Third parties who sell products using our services and stores also expose us to product liability claims. Additionally, under our A-to-z Guarantee, we may reimburse customers for certain product liability claims up to certain limits in these situations, and as our third-party seller sales grow, the cost of this program will increase and could negatively affect our operating results. Although we maintain liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all. Although we impose contractual terms on sellers that are intended to prohibit sales of certain type of products, we may not be able to detect, enforce, or collect sufficient damages for \n\nbreaches of such agreements. In addition, some of our agreements with our vendors and sellers do not indemnify us from product liability. \n\nWe Face Additional Tax Liabilities and Collection Obligations \n\nWe are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We may recognize additional tax expense and be subject to additional tax liabilities, including other liabilities for tax collection obligations due to changes in laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions. Such changes could come about as a result of economic, political, and other conditions. An increasing number of jurisdictions are considering or have adopted laws or administrative practices that impose new tax measures, including revenue-based taxes, targeting online commerce and the remote selling of goods and services. These include new obligations to withhold or collect sales, consumption, value added, or other taxes on online marketplaces and remote sellers, or other requirements that may result in liability for third party obligations. For example, non-U.S. jurisdictions have proposed or enacted taxes on online advertising and marketplace service revenues. Proliferation of these or similar unilateral tax measures may continue unless broader international tax reform is implemented. In addition, the European Union and other countries (including those in which we operate) have enacted or have committed to enact global minimum taxes, which may increase our tax expense in future years. \n\nOur results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by additional taxes imposed on us prospectively or retroactively or additional taxes or penalties resulting from the failure to comply with any collection obligations or failure to provide information about our customers, suppliers, and other third parties for tax reporting purposes to various government agencies. In some cases we also may not have sufficient notice to enable us to build systems and adopt processes to properly comply with new reporting or collection obligations by the effective date. \n\nOur tax expense and liabilities are also affected by other factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions, investments, entry into new businesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits, the applicability of special or extraterritorial tax regimes, changes in foreign exchange rates, changes in our stock price, changes to our forecasts of income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, and changes in our tax assets and liabilities and their valuation. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our tax expense, assets, and liabilities. \n\nWe are also subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions that can result in tax assessments against us. Developments in an audit, investigation, or other tax controversy can have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of these matters, interpretations of certain tax laws by authorities, and judicial, administrative, and regulatory processes in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome of any such controversy may be materially different from our expectations. For example, the Indian tax authority has asserted that tax applies to cloud services fees paid to Amazon in the U.S. We are contesting this position; however, if this matter is adversely resolved, we may be required to pay additional amounts with respect to current and prior periods and our taxes in the future could increase. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations, and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical tax accruals. \n\nWe Are Subject to Risks Related to Government Contracts and Related Procurement Regulations \n\nOur contracts with U.S., as well as state, local, and foreign, government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating to their formation, administration, and performance. We are subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts, and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contract, refunding or suspending of payments, forfeiture of profits, payment of fines, and suspension or debarment from future government business. In addition, some of these contracts are subject to periodic funding approval and/or provide for termination by the government at any time, without cause. \n\n##TABLE_START ",

Actual results and outcomes could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer demand and spending, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in demand, the degree to which we enter into, maintain, and develop commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. These risks and uncertainties, as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results or outcomes to differ significantly from management&#8217;s expectations, are described in greater detail in Item 1A of Part I, &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; \n\nOverview \n\nOur primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers. The products offered through our stores include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale and products offered by third-party sellers, and we also manufacture and sell electronic devices and produce media content. Generally, we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by third-party sellers as service sales. We seek to increase unit sales across our stores, through increased product selection, across numerous product categories. We also offer other services such as compute, storage, and database offerings, fulfillment, advertising, publishing, and digital content subscriptions. \n\nOur financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flows. Free cash flows are driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable, and cash capital expenditures, including our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment. Increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs, partially offset by investments we make in longer-term strategic initiatives, including capital expenditures focused on improving the customer experience. To increase sales of products and services, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering prices, improving availability, offering faster delivery and performance times, increasing selection, producing original content, increasing product categories and service offerings, expanding product information, improving ease of use, improving reliability, and earning customer trust. See &#8220;Results of Operations &#8212; Non-GAAP Financial Measures&#8221; below for additional information on our non-GAAP free cash flows financial measures. \n\nWe seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs. Our variable costs include product and content costs, payment processing and related transaction costs, picking, packaging, and preparing orders for shipment, transportation, customer service support, costs necessary to run AWS, and a portion of our marketing costs. Our fixed costs include the costs necessary to build and run our technology infrastructure; to build, enhance, and add features to our online stores, web services, electronic devices, and digital offerings; and to build and optimize our fulfillment network. Variable costs generally change directly with sales volume, while fixed costs generally are dependent on the timing of capacity needs, geographic expansion, category expansion, and other factors. To decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct sourcing, increase discounts from suppliers, and reduce defects in our processes. To minimize unnecessary growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture. \n\nWe seek to turn inventory quickly and collect from consumers before our payments to vendors and sellers become due. Because consumers primarily use credit cards in our stores, our receivables from consumers settle quickly. We expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by numerous factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales by us and by third-party sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability and selection of product offerings, supply chain disruptions and resulting vendor lead times, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize third-party fulfillment providers. We also expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of sales by third-party sellers, the mix \n\nof suppliers, seasonality, and changes in payment and other terms over time, including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers. \n\nWe expect spending in technology and infrastructure will increase over time as we add computer scientists, designers, software and hardware engineers, and merchandising employees. Our technology and infrastructure investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and infrastructure, including AWS, and expansion of new and existing product categories and service offerings, as well as in infrastructure to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiencies. We believe that advances in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power, data storage and analytics, improved wireless connectivity, and the practical applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning, will continue to improve users&#8217; experience on the internet and increase its ubiquity in people&#8217;s lives. To best take advantage of these continued advances in technology, we are investing in AWS, which offers a broad set of on-demand technology services, including compute, storage, database, analytics, and machine learning, and other services to developers and enterprises of all sizes. We are also investing in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices as well as other initiatives including the development of a satellite network for global broadband service and autonomous vehicles for ride-hailing services. \n\nWe seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, such as financings, acquisitions, and aligning employee compensation with shareholders&#8217; interests. We utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe this compensation model aligns the long-term interests of our shareholders and employees. In measuring shareholder dilution, we include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding, without regard to estimated forfeitures. Total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 10.6 billion and 10.8 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2023. \n\nOur financial reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends. For example, if the U.S. Dollar weakens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant. Likewise, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant. We believe that our increasing diversification beyond the U.S. economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the long-term. We also believe it is useful to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes. \n\nIn addition, the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and losses associated with the effect of movements in foreign exchange rates. Currency volatilities may continue, which may significantly impact (either positively or negatively) our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons. \n\nFor additional information about each line item addressed above, refer to Item 8 of Part II, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#8212; Note 1 &#8212; Description of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures.&#8221; \n\nOur Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 includes a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 in Item 7 of Part II, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#8221; \n\nCritical Accounting Estimates \n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with GAAP that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting estimates addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#8212; Note 1 &#8212; Description of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures.&#8221; Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions. \n\nInventories \n\nInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product \n\nvendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. These assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material write-downs in the future. As a measure of sensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of December 31, 2023, we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately $355 million. \n\nIn addition, we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components and certain products. These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other conditions, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. In addition, our actual and forecasted earnings are subject to change due to economic, political, and other conditions and significant judgment is required in determining our ability to use our deferred tax assets. \n\nOur effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions, investments, entry into new businesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, including earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in foreign exchange rates, changes in our stock price, changes to our forecasts of income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, changes in the laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions. In addition, a number of countries have enacted or are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals. \n\nWe are also currently subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. Developments in an audit, investigation, or other tax controversy could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations, and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nCash flow information is as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\nYear Ended December 31, &#160; 2022 2023 Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 46,752 $ 84,946 Investing activities (37,601) (49,833) Financing activities 9,718 (15,879) ##TABLE_END\n\nOur principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, which, at fair value, were $70.0 billion and $86.8 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2023. Amounts held in foreign currencies were $18.3 billion and $23.5 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2023. Our foreign currency balances include British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Euros, Indian Rupees, and Japanese Yen. \n\nCash provided by (used in) operating activities was $46.8 billion and $84.9 billion in 2022 and 2023. Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our consumer, seller, developer, enterprise, and content creator customers, and advertisers, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, employee compensation, payment processing and related transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments. Cash received from our customers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales. The increase in operating cash flow in 2023, compared to the prior year, was due to an increase in net income (loss), excluding non-cash expenses, and changes in working capital. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including variability in demand, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, customer and vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. \n\nCash provided by (used in) investing activities corresponds with cash capital expenditures, including leasehold improvements, incentives received from property and equipment vendors, proceeds from asset sales, cash outlays for \n\nacquisitions, investments in other companies and intellectual property rights, and purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $(37.6) billion and $(49.8) billion in 2022 and 2023, with the variability caused primarily by purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities and cash capital expenditures. Cash capital expenditures were $58.3 billion, and $48.1 billion in 2022 and 2023, which primarily reflect investments in technology infrastructure (the majority of which is to support AWS business growth) and in additional capacity to support our fulfillment network, which investments we expect to increase in 2024. We made cash payments, net of acquired cash, related to acquisition and other investment activity of $8.3 billion and $5.8 billion in 2022 and 2023. We funded the acquisitions of MGM Holdings Inc. in 2022 and 1Life Healthcare, Inc. (One Medical) in 2023 with cash on hand. In 2023, we invested $1.25 billion in a note from Anthropic, PBC, which is convertible into equity. We have an agreement that expires in Q1 2024 to invest up to an additional $2.75 billion in a second convertible note. \n\nCash provided by (used in) financing activities was $9.7 billion and $(15.9) billion in 2022 and 2023. Cash inflows from financing activities resulted from proceeds from short-term debt, and other and long-term-debt of $62.7 billion and $18.1 billion in 2022 and 2023. Cash outflows from financing activities resulted from repurchases of common stock in 2022, payments of short-term debt, and other, long-term debt, finance leases, and financing obligations of $53.0 billion and $34.0 billion in 2022 and 2023. Property and equipment acquired under finance leases was $675 million and $642 million in 2022 and 2023. \n\nWe had no borrowings outstanding under the two unsecured revolving credit facilities or the commercial paper programs, we had $682 million of borrowings outstanding under the secured revolving credit facility, and the entire amount of the term loan has been repaid as of December 31, 2023. See Item 8 of Part II, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#8212; Note 6 &#8212; Debt&#8221; for additional information. \n\nAs of December 31, 2023, cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries were $4.7 billion. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts. \n\nOur U.S. taxable income is reduced by accelerated depreciation deductions and increased by the impact of capitalized research and development expenses. U.S. tax rules provide for enhanced accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing us to expense a portion of qualified property, primarily equipment. These enhanced deductions are scheduled to phase out annually from 2023 through 2026. Our federal tax provision included a partial accelerated depreciation deduction election for 2021, and a full election for 2022 and 2023. Additionally, effective January 1, 2022, research and development expenses are required to be capitalized and amortized for U.S. tax purposes, which delays the deductibility of these expenses. Cash paid for U.S. (federal and state) and foreign income taxes (net of refunds) totaled $6.0 billion and $11.2 billion for 2022 and 2023. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2023, restricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $365 million and $503 million. See Item 8 of Part II, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#8212; Note 6 &#8212; Debt&#8221; and &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#8212; Note 7 &#8212; Commitments and Contingencies&#8221; for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments, as well as our pledged assets. Additionally, we have purchase obligations and open purchase orders, including for inventory and capital expenditures, that support normal operations and are primarily due in the next twelve months. These purchase obligations and open purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual provisions. \n\nWe believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, as well as our borrowing arrangements, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next twelve months. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part I, &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities, obtain finance and operating lease arrangements, enter into financing obligations, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position. \n\nThe sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, capital infrastructure, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to secure additional financing, or issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional credit lines or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. In addition, economic conditions and actions by policymaking bodies are contributing to changing interest rates and significant capital market volatility, which, along with any increases in our borrowing levels, could increase our future borrowing costs. \n\nResults of Operations \n\nWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations. See Item 8 of Part II, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#8212; Note 10 &#8212; Segment Information.&#8221; \n\nOverview \n\nMacroeconomic factors, including inflation, increased interest rates, significant capital market and supply chain volatility, and global economic and geopolitical developments, have direct and indirect impacts on our results of operations that are difficult to isolate and quantify. In addition, changes in fuel, utility, and food costs, interest rates, and economic outlook may impact customer demand and our ability to forecast consumer spending patterns. We also expect the current macroeconomic environment and enterprise customer cost optimization efforts to impact our AWS revenue growth rates. We expect some or all of these factors to continue to impact our operations into Q1 2024. \n\nNet Sales \n\nNet sales include product and service sales. Product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital media content where we record revenue gross. Service sales primarily represent third-party seller fees, which includes commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees, AWS sales, advertising services, Amazon Prime membership fees, and certain digital media content subscriptions. Net sales information is as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\nYear Ended December 31, &#160; 2022 2023 Net Sales: North America $ 315,880 $ 352,828 International 118,007 131,200 AWS 80,096 90,757 Consolidated $ 513,983 $ 574,785 Year-over-year Percentage Growth (Decline): North America 13 % 12 % International (8) 11 AWS 29 13 Consolidated 9 12 Year-over-year Percentage Growth, excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates: North America 13 % 12 % International 4 11 AWS 29 13 Consolidated 13 12 Net Sales Mix: North America 61 % 61 % International 23 23 AWS 16 16 Consolidated 100 % 100 % ##TABLE_END\n\nSales increased 12% in 2023, compared to the prior year. Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced net sales by $71 million in 2023. For a discussion of the effect of foreign exchange rates on sales growth, see &#8220;Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates&#8221; below. \n\nNorth America sales increased 12% in 2023, compared to the prior year. The sales growth primarily reflects increased unit sales, primarily by third-party sellers, advertising sales, and subscription services. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued focus on price, selection, and convenience for our customers, including from our shipping offers. \n\nInternational sales increased 11% in 2023, compared to the prior year. The sales growth primarily reflects increased unit sales, primarily by third-party sellers, advertising sales, and subscription services. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued focus on price, selection, and convenience for our customers, including from our shipping offers. Changes in foreign exchange rates increased International net sales by $88 million in 2023. \n\nAWS sales increased 13% in 2023, compared to the prior year. The sales growth primarily reflects increased customer usage, partially offset by pricing changes, primarily driven by long-term customer contracts. \n\nOperating Income (Loss) \n\nOperating income (loss) by segment is as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2022 2023 Operating Income (Loss) North America $ (2,847) $ 14,877 International (7,746) (2,656) AWS 22,841 24,631 Consolidated $ 12,248 $ 36,852 ##TABLE_END\n\nOperating income was $12.2 billion and $36.9 billion for 2022 and 2023. We believe that operating income is a more meaningful measure than gross profit and gross margin due to the diversity of our product categories and services. \n\nThe North America operating income in 2023, as compared to the operating loss in the prior year, is primarily due to increased unit sales and increased advertising sales, partially offset by increased shipping and fulfillment costs and increased technology and infrastructure costs. \n\nThe decrease in International operating loss in absolute dollars in 2023, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased unit sales and increased advertising sales, partially offset by increased fulfillment and shipping costs and increased technology and infrastructure costs. Changes in foreign exchange rates positively impacted operating loss by $246 million in 2023. \n\nThe increase in AWS operating income in absolute dollars in 2023, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased sales, partially offset by increased payroll and related expenses and spending on technology infrastructure, both of which were primarily driven by additional investments to support AWS business growth. Changes in foreign exchange rates positively impacted operating income by $220 million in 2023. \n\nOperating Expenses \n\nInformation about operating expenses is as follows (in millions): &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Year Ended December 31, &#160; 2022 2023 Operating Expenses: Cost of sales $ 288,831 $ 304,739 Fulfillment 84,299 90,619 Technology and infrastructure 73,213 85,622 Sales and marketing 42,238 44,370 General and administrative 11,891 11,816 Other operating expense (income), net 1,263 767 Total operating expenses $ 501,735 $ 537,933 Year-over-year Percentage Growth (Decline): Cost of sales 6 % 6 % Fulfillment 12 7 Technology and infrastructure 31 17 Sales and marketing 30 5 General and administrative 35 (1) Other operating expense (income), net 1,936 (39) Percent of Net Sales: Cost of sales 56.2 % 53.0 % Fulfillment 16.4 15.8 Technology and infrastructure 14.2 14.9 Sales and marketing 8.2 7.7 General and administrative 2.3 2.1 Other operating expense (income), net 0.2 0.1 ##TABLE_END\n\nCost of Sales \n\nCost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products, inbound and outbound shipping costs, including costs related to sortation and delivery centers and where we are the transportation service provider, and digital media content costs where we record revenue gross, including video and music. \n\nThe increase in cost of sales in absolute dollars in 2023, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased product and shipping costs resulting from increased sales, partially offset by fulfillment network efficiencies and lower transportation rates. Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced cost of sales by $254 million in 2023. \n\nShipping costs were $83.5 billion and $89.5 billion in 2022 and 2023. Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. We expect our cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate, we use more expensive shipping methods, and we offer additional services. We seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes, optimizing our fulfillment network, negotiating better terms with our suppliers, and achieving better operating efficiencies. We believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success, and one way we offer lower prices is through shipping offers. \n\nCosts to operate our AWS segment are primarily classified as &#8220;Technology and infrastructure&#8221; as we leverage a shared infrastructure that supports both our internal technology requirements and external sales to AWS customers. \n\nFulfillment \n\nFulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International fulfillment centers, physical stores, and customer service centers and payment processing costs. While AWS payment processing and related transaction costs are included in &#8220;Fulfillment,&#8221; AWS costs are primarily classified as &#8220;Technology and infrastructure.&#8221; Fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as payment processing and related transaction costs, our level of productivity and accuracy, changes in volume, size, and weight of units received and \n\nfulfilled, the extent to which third-party sellers utilize Fulfillment by Amazon services, timing of fulfillment network and physical store expansion, the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties, mix of products and services sold, and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer self-service features. Additionally, sales by our sellers have higher payment processing and related transaction costs as a percentage of net sales compared to our retail sales because payment processing costs are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions. \n\nThe increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in 2023, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased sales and investments in our fulfillment network, partially offset by fulfillment network efficiencies. Changes in foreign exchange rates increased fulfillment costs by $52 million in 2023. \n\nWe seek to expand our fulfillment network to accommodate a greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services. We regularly evaluate our facility requirements. \n\nTechnology and Infrastructure \n\nTechnology and infrastructure costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products and services, development, design, and maintenance of our stores, curation and display of products and services made available in our online stores, and infrastructure costs. Infrastructure costs include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and other expenses necessary to support AWS and other Amazon businesses. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services to our customers, including expenditures related to initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices and the development of a satellite network for global broadband service and autonomous vehicles for ride-hailing services. \n\nWe seek to invest efficiently in numerous areas of technology and infrastructure so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiency through rapid technology developments, while operating at an ever increasing scale. Our technology and infrastructure investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We expect spending in technology and infrastructure to increase over time as we continue to add employees and infrastructure. These costs are allocated to segments based on usage. The increase in technology and infrastructure costs in absolute dollars in 2023, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to an increase in spending on infrastructure and increased payroll and related costs associated with technical teams responsible for expanding our existing products and services and initiatives to introduce new products and service offerings. \n\nSales and Marketing \n\nSales and marketing costs include advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, including sales commissions related to AWS. We direct customers to our stores primarily through a number of marketing channels, such as our sponsored search, social and online advertising, third-party customer referrals, television advertising, and other initiatives. Our marketing costs are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changes in rates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing costs. \n\nThe increase in sales and marketing costs in absolute dollars in 2023, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities. \n\nWhile costs associated with Amazon Prime membership benefits and other shipping offers are not included in sales and marketing expense, we view these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely. \n\nGeneral and Administrative \n\nGeneral and administrative costs were $11.9 billion and $11.8 billion during 2022 and 2023, and were primarily related to payroll and related expenses and professional fees. \n\nOther Operating Expense (Income), Net \n\nOther operating expense (income), net was $1.3 billion and $767 million during 2022 and 2023, and was primarily related to asset impairments for physical store closures in 2022 and for fulfillment network facilities and physical store closures in 2023, and the amortization of intangible assets. \n\nInterest Income and Expense \n\nOur interest income was $989 million and $2.9 billion during 2022 and 2023, primarily due to an increase in prevailing rates. We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term marketable debt securities. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds based on the prevailing rates, which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested. \n\nInterest expense was $2.4 billion and $3.2 billion in 2022 and 2023 and was primarily related to debt and finance leases. See Item 8 of Part II, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#8212; Note 4 &#8212; Leases and Note 6 &#8212; Debt&#8221; for additional information. \n\nOur long-term lease liabilities were $73.0 billion and $77.3 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2023. Our long-term debt was $67.1 billion and $58.3 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2023. See Item 8 of Part II, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#8212; Note 4 &#8212; Leases and Note 6 &#8212; Debt&#8221; for additional information. \n\nOther Income (Expense), Net \n\nOther income (expense), net was $(16.8) billion and $938 million during 2022 and 2023. The primary components of other income (expense), net are related to equity securities valuations and adjustments, equity warrant valuations, and foreign currency. Included in other income (expense), net in 2022 and 2023 is a marketable equity securities valuation gain (loss) of $(12.7) billion and $797 million from our equity investment in Rivian. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nOur effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including variability in our pre-tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, intercompany transactions, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in how we do business, acquisitions, investments, developments in tax controversies, changes in our stock price, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, foreign currency gains (losses), changes in statutes, regulations, case law, and administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions, and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized. Our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pre-tax income or loss. For example, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pre-tax income is lower. In addition, we record valuation allowances against deferred tax assets when there is uncertainty about our ability to generate future income in relevant jurisdictions. \n\nWe recorded a provision (benefit) for income taxes of $(3.2) billion and $7.1 billion in 2022 and 2023. See Item 8 of Part II, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#8212; Note 9 &#8212; Income Taxes&#8221; for additional information. \n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures \n\nRegulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of free cash flows and the effect of foreign exchange rates on our consolidated statements of operations meet the definition of non-GAAP financial measures. \n\nWe provide multiple measures of free cash flows because we believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with cash and through finance leases and financing obligations. \n\nFree Cash Flow \n\nFree cash flow is cash flow from operations reduced by &#8220;Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives.&#8221; The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, &#8220;Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,&#8221; for 2022 and 2023 (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Year Ended December 31, &#160; 2022 2023 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 46,752 $ 84,946 Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives (58,321) (48,133) Free cash flow $ (11,569) $ 36,813 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (37,601) $ (49,833) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ 9,718 $ (15,879) ##TABLE_END\n\nFree Cash Flow Less Principal Repayments of Finance Leases and Financing Obligations \n\nFree cash flow less principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations is free cash flow reduced by &#8220;Principal repayments of finance leases&#8221; and &#8220;Principal repayments of financing obligations.&#8221; Principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations approximates the actual payments of cash for our finance leases and financing obligations. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow less principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, &#8220;Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,&#8221; for 2022 and 2023 (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Year Ended December 31, &#160; 2022 2023 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 46,752 $ 84,946 Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives (58,321) (48,133) Free cash flow (11,569) 36,813 Principal repayments of finance leases (7,941) (4,384) Principal repayments of financing obligations (248) (271) Free cash flow less principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations $ (19,758) $ 32,158 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (37,601) $ (49,833) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ 9,718 $ (15,879) ##TABLE_END\n\nFree Cash Flow Less Equipment Finance Leases and Principal Repayments of All Other Finance Leases and Financing Obligations \n\nFree cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing obligations is free cash flow reduced by equipment acquired under finance leases, which is included in &#8220;Property and equipment acquired under finance leases, net of remeasurements and modifications,&#8221; principal repayments of all other finance lease liabilities, which is included in &#8220;Principal repayments of finance leases,&#8221; and &#8220;Principal repayments of financing obligations.&#8221; All other finance lease liabilities and financing obligations consists of property. In this measure, equipment acquired under finance leases is reflected as if these assets had been purchased with cash, which is not the case as these assets have been leased. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing obligations to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, &#8220;Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,&#8221; for 2022 and 2023 (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Year Ended December 31, &#160; 2022 2023 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 46,752 $ 84,946 Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives (58,321) (48,133) Free cash flow (11,569) 36,813 Equipment acquired under finance leases (1) (299) (310) Principal repayments of all other finance leases (2) (670) (683) Principal repayments of financing obligations (248) (271) Free cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing obligations $ (12,786) $ 35,549 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (37,601) $ (49,833) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ 9,718 $ (15,879) ##TABLE_END\n\n___________________ \n\n(1) For the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2023, this amount relates to equipment included in &#8220;Property and equipment acquired under finance leases, net of remeasurements and modifications&#8221; of $675 million and $642 million. \n\n(2) For the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2023, this amount relates to property included in &#8220;Principal repayments of finance leases&#8221; of $7,941 million and $4,384 million. \n\nAll of these free cash flows measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the overall cash flow statement and do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, these measures of free cash flows do not incorporate the portion of payments representing principal reductions of debt or cash payments for business acquisitions. Additionally, our mix of property and equipment acquisitions with cash or other financing options may change over time. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flows measures only as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows. \n\nEffect of Foreign Exchange Rates \n\nInformation regarding the effect of foreign exchange rates, versus the U.S. Dollar, on our net sales, operating expenses, and operating income is provided to show reported period operating results had the foreign exchange rates remained the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period. The effect on our net sales, operating expenses, and operating income from changes in our foreign exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar is as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Year Ended December 31, 2022 Year Ended December 31, 2023 &#160; As Reported Exchange Rate Effect (1) At Prior Year Rates (2) As Reported Exchange Rate Effect (1) At Prior Year Rates (2) Net sales $ 513,983 $ 15,495 $ 529,478 $ 574,785 $ 71 $ 574,856 Operating expenses 501,735 16,356 518,091 537,933 531 538,464 Operating income 12,248 (861) 11,387 36,852 (460) 36,392 ##TABLE_END\n\n___________________ \n\n(1) Represents the change in reported amounts resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates from those in effect in the comparable prior year period for operating results. \n\n(2) Represents the outcome that would have resulted had foreign exchange rates in the reported period been the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period for operating results. \n\nGuidance \n\nWe provided guidance on February 1, 2024, in our earnings release furnished on Form 8-K as set forth below. These forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com&#8217;s expectations as of February 1, 2024, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, as well as those outlined in Item 1A of Part I, &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; \n\nFirst Quarter 2024 Guidance \n\n&#8226; Net sales are expected to be between $138.0 billion and $143.5 billion, or to grow between 8% and 13% compared with first quarter 2023. This guidance anticipates a favorable impact of approximately 40 basis points from foreign exchange rates. \n\n&#8226; Operating income is expected to be between $8.0 billion and $12.0 billion, compared with $4.8 billion in first quarter 2023. This guidance includes approximately $0.9 billion lower depreciation expense due to an increase in the estimated useful life of our servers beginning on January 1, 2024. \n\n&#8226; This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded. \n\n##TABLE_START ",
    "item_7A": " Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk ##TABLE_END\n\nWe are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the market values of our investments. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is set forth below and in Item 7 of Part II, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Liquidity and Capital Resources.&#8221; \n\nInterest Rate Risk \n\nOur exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our debt. Our long-term debt is carried at amortized cost and fluctuations in interest rates do not impact our consolidated financial statements. However, the fair value of our long-term debt, which pays interest at a fixed rate, will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. \n\nWe generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term marketable debt securities. Marketable debt securities with fixed interest rates may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. The following table provides information about our cash equivalents and marketable debt securities, including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted-average interest rates as of December 31, 2023 (in millions, except percentages): \n\n##TABLE_START 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 Thereafter Total Estimated Fair Value as of December 31, 2023 Money market funds $ 39,160 $ &#8212; $ &#8212; $ &#8212; $ &#8212; $ &#8212; $ 39,160 $ 39,160 Weighted average interest rate 5.32 % &#8212; % &#8212; % &#8212; % &#8212; % &#8212; % 5.32 % Corporate debt securities 25,075 2,227 715 9 &#8212; &#8212; 28,026 27,805 Weighted average interest rate 5.13 % 1.30 % 1.51 % 2.33 % &#8212; % &#8212; % 4.74 % U.S. government and agency securities 552 501 398 50 43 230 1,774 1,699 Weighted average interest rate 3.24 % 1.49 % 1.12 % 0.97 % 0.67 % 1.31 % 1.89 % Asset-backed securities 789 349 115 143 13 291 1,700 1,646 Weighted average interest rate 1.34 % 2.09 % 1.20 % 1.67 % 1.66 % 1.33 % 1.51 % Foreign government and agency securities 506 &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; 506 505 Weighted average interest rate 5.28 % &#8212; % &#8212; % &#8212; % &#8212; % &#8212; % 5.28 % Other debt securities 62 46 &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; &#8212; 108 104 Weighted average interest rate 0.55 % 1.07 % &#8212; % &#8212; % &#8212; % &#8212; % 0.78 % $ 66,144 $ 3,123 $ 1,228 $ 202 $ 56 $ 521 $ 71,274 Cash equivalents and marketable debt securities $ 70,919 ##TABLE_END\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had long-term debt with a face value of $67.2 billion, including the current portion, primarily consisting of fixed rate unsecured senior notes. See Item 8 of Part II, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#8212; Note 6 &#8212; Debt&#8221; for additional information. \n\nForeign Exchange Risk \n\nDuring 2023, net sales from our International segment accounted for 23% of our consolidated revenues. Net sales and related expenses generated from our internationally-focused stores, including within Canada and Mexico (which are included in our North America segment), are primarily denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding stores and primarily include Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our internationally-focused stores and AWS are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, as foreign exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates throughout the year compared to rates in effect the prior year, International segment net sales increased by $88 million in comparison with the prior year. \n\nWe have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (&#8220;foreign funds&#8221;). Based on the balance of foreign funds as of December 31, 2023, of $23.5 billion, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in declines of $1.2 billion, $2.3 billion, and $4.7 billion. \n\nWe also have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various currencies. Based on the intercompany balances as of December 31, 2023, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange rates would result in losses of $320 million, $640 million, and $1.3 billion, recorded to &#8220;Other income (expense), net.&#8221; \n\nSee Item 7 of Part II, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Results of Operations &#8212; Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates&#8221; for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in foreign exchange rates. \n\nEquity Investment Risk \n\nAs of December 31, 2023, our recorded value in equity, equity warrant, and convertible debt investments in public and private companies was $9.6 billion. Our equity and equity warrant investments in publicly traded companies, which include our equity investment in Rivian, represent $5.7 billion of our investments as of December 31, 2023, and are recorded at fair value, which is subject to market price volatility. We record our equity warrant investments in private companies at fair value and adjust our equity investments in private companies for observable price changes or impairments. Valuations of private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data. The current global economic conditions provide additional uncertainty. As such, we believe that market sensitivities are not practicable. See Item 8 of Part II, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#8212; Note 1 &#8212; Description of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures&#8221; for additional information. \n\n##TABLE_START ",

(the Company) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders&#8217; equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the &#8220;consolidated financial statements&#8221;). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. \n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 1, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#8217;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nCritical Audit Matter \n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. \n\n##TABLE_START Uncertain Tax Positions Description of the Matter As discussed in Notes 1 and 9 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions and during the ordinary course of business, there are many tax positions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. As a result, significant judgment is required in evaluating the Company&#8217;s tax positions and determining its provision for income taxes. The Company uses significant judgment in (1) determining whether a tax position&#8217;s technical merits are more likely than not to be sustained and (2) measuring the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition. As of December 31, 2023, the Company reported accrued liabilities of $5.2 billion for various tax contingencies. \n\nAuditing the recognition and measurement of the Company&#8217;s tax contingencies was challenging because the evaluation of whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the benefit of various tax positions can be complex and involves significant auditor judgment. Management&#8217;s evaluation of tax positions is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings, and may be impacted by regulatory changes and judicial and examination activity. \n\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We tested controls over the Company&#8217;s process to assess the technical merits of its tax contingencies, including controls over: the assessment as to whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained; the measurement of the benefit of its tax positions, both initially and on an ongoing basis; and the development of the related disclosures. \n\nWe involved our international tax, transfer pricing, and research and development tax professionals in assessing the technical merits of certain of the Company&#8217;s tax positions. Depending on the nature of the specific tax position and, as applicable, developments with the relevant tax authorities relating thereto, our procedures included obtaining and examining the Company&#8217;s analysis including the Company&#8217;s correspondence with such tax authorities and evaluating the underlying facts upon which the tax positions are based. We used our knowledge of and experience with international, transfer pricing, and other income tax laws of the relevant taxing jurisdictions to evaluate the Company&#8217;s accounting for its tax contingencies. We evaluated developments in the applicable regulatory environments to assess potential effects on the Company&#8217;s positions, including recent decisions in relevant court cases. We analyzed the appropriateness of the Company&#8217;s assumptions and the accuracy of the Company&#8217;s calculations and data used to determine the amount of tax benefits to recognize. We evaluated the Company&#8217;s income tax disclosures in relation to these matters. \n\n##TABLE_END\n\n/s/ Ernst &#38; Young LLP \n\nWe have served as the Company&#8217;s auditor since 1996. \n\nSeattle, Washington \n\nFebruary 1, 2024 \n\nAMAZON.COM, INC. \n\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS \n\n(in millions) \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n&#160;

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS, ACCOUNTING POLICIES, AND SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES \n\nDescription of Business \n\nWe seek to be Earth&#8217;s most customer-centric company. In each of our segments, we serve our primary customer sets, consisting of consumers, sellers, developers, enterprises, content creators, advertisers, and employees. We serve consumers through our online and physical stores and focus on selection, price, and convenience. We offer programs that enable sellers to grow their businesses, sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders using our services, and programs that allow authors, independent publishers, musicians, filmmakers, Twitch streamers, skill and app developers, and others to publish and sell content. We serve developers and enterprises of all sizes through AWS, which offers a broad set of on-demand technology services, including compute, storage, database, analytics, and machine learning, and other services. We also manufacture and sell electronic devices. In addition, we provide advertising services to sellers, vendors, publishers, authors, and others, through programs such as sponsored ads, display, and video advertising. \n\nWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. See &#8220;Note 10 &#8212; Segment Information.&#8221; \n\nCommon Stock Split \n\nOn May 27, 2022, we effected a 20 -for-1 stock split of our common stock and proportionately increased the number of authorized shares of common stock. All share, restricted stock unit (&#8220;RSU&#8221;), and per share or per RSU information throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split. The shares of common stock retain a par value of $ 0.01 per share. Accordingly, an amount equal to the par value of the increased shares resulting from the stock split was reclassified from &#8220;Additional paid-in capital&#8221; to &#8220;Common stock.&#8221; \n\nPrior Period Reclassifications \n\nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. &#8220;Other assets&#8221; were reclassified out of &#8220;Accounts receivable, net and other&#8221; on our consolidated statements of cash flows. \n\nPrinciples of Consolidation \n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Amazon.com, Inc. and its consolidated entities (collectively, the &#8220;Company&#8221;), consisting of its wholly-owned subsidiaries and those entities in which we have a variable interest and of which we are the primary beneficiary, including certain entities in India and certain entities that support our health care services and seller lending financing activities. Intercompany balances and transactions between consolidated entities are eliminated. \n\nUse of Estimates \n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, income taxes, useful lives of equipment, commitments and contingencies, valuation of acquired intangibles and goodwill, stock-based compensation forfeiture rates, vendor funding, inventory valuation, collectability of receivables, impairment of property and equipment and operating leases, valuation and impairment of investments, self-insurance liabilities, and viewing patterns of capitalized video content. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. For example, in Q4 2023 we completed a useful life study for our servers and are increasing the useful life from five years to six years in January 2024, which, based on servers that are included in &#8220;Property and equipment, net&#8221; as of December 31, 2023, will have an anticipated impact to our 2024 operating income of $ 3.1 billion. We had previously increased the useful life of our servers from four years to five years in January 2022. \n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded approximately $ 1.1 billion, of which $ 720 million was recorded in the fourth quarter, of impairments of property and equipment and operating leases primarily related to physical stores. These charges were recorded in &#8220;Other operating expense (income), net&#8221; on our consolidated statements of operations and primarily impacted our North America segment. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we also recorded expenses of approximately $ 480 million, primarily in &#8220;Fulfillment&#8221;, on our consolidated statements of operations primarily relating to terminating contracts for certain leases not yet commenced as well as other purchase commitments, which primarily impacted our North America segment. \n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded approximately $ 720 million, of which $ 640 million was recorded in the fourth quarter, of estimated severance costs primarily related to planned role eliminations. These charges were recorded primarily in &#8220;Technology and infrastructure,&#8221; &#8220;Fulfillment,&#8221; and &#8220;General and administrative&#8221; on our consolidated statements of operations and primarily impacted our North America segment. \n\nCharges for impairment, expenses for terminating contracts and other commitments, and severance costs were not material to our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2023. \n\nSupplemental Cash Flow Information \n\nThe following table shows supplemental cash flow information (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2021 2022 2023 SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION: Cash paid for interest on debt, net of capitalized interest $ 1,098 &#160; $ 1,561 &#160; $ 2,608 &#160; Cash paid for operating leases $ 6,722 &#160; $ 8,633 &#160; $ 10,453 &#160; Cash paid for interest on finance leases $ 521 &#160; $ 374 &#160; $ 308 &#160; Cash paid for interest on financing obligations $ 153 &#160; $ 207 &#160; $ 196 &#160; Cash paid for income taxes, net of refunds $ 3,688 &#160; $ 6,035 &#160; $ 11,179 &#160; Assets acquired under operating leases $ 25,369 &#160; $ 18,800 &#160; $ 14,052 &#160; Property and equipment acquired under finance leases, net of remeasurements and modifications $ 7,061 &#160; $ 675 &#160; $ 642 &#160; Property and equipment recognized during the construction period of build-to-suit lease arrangements $ 5,846 &#160; $ 3,187 &#160; $ 357 &#160; Property and equipment derecognized after the construction period of build-to-suit lease arrangements, with the associated leases recognized as operating $ 230 &#160; $ 5,158 &#160; $ 1,374 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nEarnings Per Share \n\nBasic earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares. Diluted earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares including the dilutive effect of stock awards as determined under the treasury stock method. In periods when we have a net loss, stock awards are excluded from our calculation of earnings per share as their inclusion would have an antidilutive effect. \n\nThe following table shows the calculation of diluted shares (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\nYear Ended December 31, &#160; 2021 2022 2023 Shares used in computation of basic earnings per share 10,117 &#160; 10,189 &#160; 10,304 &#160; Total dilutive effect of outstanding stock awards 179 &#160; &#8212; &#160; 188 &#160; Shares used in computation of diluted earnings per share 10,296 &#160; 10,189 &#160; 10,492 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nRevenue \n\nRevenue is measured based on the amount of consideration that we expect to receive, reduced by estimates for return allowances, promotional discounts, and rebates. Revenue also excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties, including sales and indirect taxes. In arrangements where we have multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation using the relative stand-alone selling price. We generally determine stand-alone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers or using expected cost plus a margin. \n\nA description of our principal revenue generating activities is as follows: \n\nRetail sales - We offer consumer products through our online and physical stores. Revenue is recognized when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, which generally occurs upon our delivery to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon delivery, to the customer. \n\nThird-party seller services - We offer programs that enable sellers to sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders using our services. We are not the seller of record in these transactions. The commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees we earn from these arrangements are recognized when the services are rendered, which generally occurs upon delivery of the related products to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon delivery, to the customer. \n\nAdvertising services - We provide advertising services to sellers, vendors, publishers, authors, and others, through programs such as sponsored ads, display, and video advertising. Revenue is recognized as ads are delivered based on the number of clicks or impressions. \n\nSubscription services - Our subscription sales include fees associated with Amazon Prime memberships and access to content including digital video, audiobooks, digital music, e-books, and other non-AWS subscription services. Prime memberships provide our customers with access to an evolving suite of benefits that represent a single stand-ready obligation. Subscriptions are paid for at the time of or in advance of delivering the services. Revenue from such arrangements is recognized over the subscription period. \n\nAWS - Our AWS arrangements include global sales of compute, storage, database, and other services. Revenue is allocated to services using stand-alone selling prices and is primarily recognized when the customer uses these services, based on the quantity of services rendered, such as compute or storage capacity delivered on-demand. Certain services, including compute and database, are also offered as a fixed quantity over a specified term, for which revenue is recognized ratably. Sales commissions we pay in connection with contracts that exceed one year are capitalized and amortized over the contract term. \n\nOther - Other revenue includes sales related to various other offerings, such as certain licensing and distribution of video content, health care services, and shipping services, and our co-branded credit card agreements. Revenue is recognized when content is licensed or distributed and as or when services are performed. \n\nReturn Allowances \n\nReturn allowances, which reduce revenue and cost of sales, are estimated using historical experience. Liabilities for return allowances are included in &#8220;Accrued expenses and other&#8221; and were $ 1.0 billion, $ 1.3 billion, and $ 1.4 billion as of December 31, 2021, 2022, and 2023. Additions to the allowance were $ 5.1 billion, $ 5.5 billion, and $ 5.2 billion and deductions from the allowance were $ 4.9 billion, $ 5.2 billion, and $ 5.1 billion in 2021, 2022, and 2023. Included in &#8220;Inventories&#8221; on our consolidated balance sheets are assets totaling $ 882 million, $ 948 million, and $ 992 million as of December 31, 2021, 2022, and 2023, for the rights to recover products from customers associated with our liabilities for return allowances. \n\nCost of Sales \n\nCost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products, inbound and outbound shipping costs, including costs related to sortation and delivery centers and where we are the transportation service provider, and digital media content costs where we record revenue gross, including video and music. Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory, and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. Payment processing and related transaction costs, including those associated with seller transactions, are classified in &#8220;Fulfillment&#8221; on our consolidated statements of operations. \n\nVendor Agreements \n\nWe have agreements with our vendors to receive consideration primarily for cooperative marketing efforts, promotions, incentives, and volume rebates. We generally consider these amounts received from vendors to be a reduction of the prices we pay for their goods, including property and equipment, or services, and are recorded as a reduction of the cost of inventory, cost of services, or cost of property and equipment. Volume rebates typically depend on reaching minimum purchase thresholds. We evaluate the likelihood of reaching purchase thresholds using past experience and current year forecasts. When volume rebates can be reasonably estimated, we record a portion of the rebate as we make progress towards the purchase threshold. \n\nFulfillment \n\nFulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International segments&#8217; fulfillment centers, physical stores, and customer service centers, including facilities and equipment expenses, such as depreciation and amortization, and rent; costs attributable to buying, receiving, inspecting, and warehousing inventories; picking, packaging, and preparing customer orders for shipment; payment processing and related transaction costs, including costs associated with our guarantee for certain seller transactions; responding to inquiries from customers; and supply chain management for our manufactured electronic devices. Fulfillment costs also include amounts paid to third parties that assist us in fulfillment and customer service operations. \n\nTechnology and Infrastructure \n\nTechnology and infrastructure costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products and services, development, design, and maintenance of our stores, curation and display of products and services made available in our online stores, and infrastructure costs. Infrastructure costs include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and other expenses necessary to support AWS and other Amazon businesses. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services to our customers, including expenditures related to initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices and the development of a satellite network for global broadband service and autonomous vehicles for ride-hailing services. Technology and infrastructure costs are generally expensed as incurred. \n\nSales and Marketing \n\nSales and marketing costs include advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, including sales commissions related to AWS. We pay commissions to third parties when their customer referrals result in sales. We also participate in cooperative advertising arrangements with certain of our vendors, and other third parties. \n\nAdvertising and other promotional costs to market our products and services are expensed as incurred and were $ 16.9 billion, $ 20.6 billion, and $ 20.3 billion in 2021, 2022, and 2023. \n\nGeneral and Administrative \n\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of costs for corporate functions, including payroll and related expenses; facilities and equipment expenses, such as depreciation and amortization expense and rent; and professional fees. \n\nStock-Based Compensation \n\nCompensation cost for all equity-classified stock awards expected to vest is measured at fair value on the date of grant and recognized over the service period. The fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock. Such value is recognized as expense over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures, using the accelerated method. Under this method, approximately 50 % of the grant date fair value is recognized as expense in the first year of grant for the majority of our stock-based compensation awards. The accelerated method also adds a higher level of sensitivity and complexity in estimating forfeitures. If an award is forfeited early in its life, the adjustment to compensation expense is much greater under an accelerated method than under a straight-line method. The estimated number of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including historical forfeiture experience by grant year and employee level. Additionally, stock-based compensation includes stock appreciation rights that are expected to settle in cash. These liability-classified awards are remeasured to fair value at the end of each reporting period until settlement or expiration. \n\nOther Operating Expense (Income), Net \n\nOther operating expense (income), net, consists primarily of the amortization of intangible assets, and asset impairments for physical store closures in 2022 and for fulfillment network facilities and physical store closures in 2023. \n\nOther Income (Expense), Net \n\nOther income (expense), net, is as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2021 2022 2023 Marketable equity securities valuation gains (losses) $ 11,526 &#160; $ ( 13,870 ) $ 984 &#160; Equity warrant valuation gains (losses) 1,315 &#160; ( 2,132 ) 26 &#160; Upward adjustments relating to equity investments in private companies 1,866 &#160; 76 &#160; 40 &#160; Foreign currency gains (losses) ( 55 ) ( 340 ) 65 &#160; Other, net ( 19 ) ( 540 ) ( 177 ) Total other income (expense), net $ 14,633 &#160; $ ( 16,806 ) $ 938 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nIncluded in other income (expense), net in 2022 and 2023 is a marketable equity securities valuation gain (loss) of $( 12.7 ) billion and $ 797 million from our equity investment in Rivian Automotive, Inc. (&#8220;Rivian&#8221;). Our investment in Rivian&#8217;s preferred stock was accounted for at cost, with adjustments for observable changes in prices or impairments, prior to Rivian&#8217;s initial public offering in November 2021, which resulted in the conversion of our preferred stock to Class A common stock. As of December 31, 2023, we held 158 million shares of Rivian&#8217;s Class A common stock, representing an approximate 16 % ownership interest, and an approximate 15 % voting interest. We determined that we have the ability to exercise significant influence over Rivian through our equity investment, our commercial arrangement for the purchase of electric vehicles and jointly-owned intellectual property, and one of our employees serving on Rivian&#8217;s board of directors. We elected the fair value option to account for our equity investment in Rivian, which is included in &#8220;Marketable securities&#8221; on our consolidated balance sheets, and had a fair value of $ 2.9 billion and $ 3.7 billion as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023. The investment was subject to regulatory sales restrictions resulting in a discount for lack of marketability of approximately $ 800 million as of December 31, 2021, which expired in Q1 2022. \n\nRequired summarized financial information of Rivian as disclosed in its most recent SEC filings is as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2021 Year Ended December 31, 2022 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 Revenues $ 55 &#160; $ 1,658 &#160; $ 3,119 &#160; Gross profit ( 465 ) ( 3,123 ) ( 1,424 ) Loss from operations ( 4,220 ) ( 6,856 ) ( 4,158 ) Net loss ( 4,688 ) ( 6,752 ) ( 3,911 ) ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START December 31, 2022 September 30, 2023 Total current assets $ 13,130 &#160; $ 12,086 &#160; Total assets 17,876 &#160; 16,456 &#160; Total current liabilities 2,424 &#160; 2,624 &#160; Total liabilities 4,077 &#160; 5,904 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nIncome Taxes \n\nIncome tax expense includes U.S. (federal and state) and foreign income taxes. Certain foreign subsidiary earnings and losses are subject to current U.S. taxation and the subsequent repatriation of those earnings is not subject to tax in the U.S. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts. \n\nDeferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases, as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered. \n\nDeferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future periods. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe they will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including recent cumulative loss experience and expectations of future earnings, capital gains and investment in such jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. \n\nWe utilize a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain income tax positions (income tax contingencies). The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We consider many factors when evaluating our tax positions and estimating our tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately forecast actual outcomes. We include interest and penalties related to our income tax contingencies in income tax expense. \n\nFair Value of Financial Instruments \n\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. To increase the comparability of fair value measures, the following hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value: \n\nLevel 1 &#8212; Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets. \n\nLevel 2 &#8212; Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. \n\nLevel 3 &#8212; Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants. These valuations require significant judgment. \n\nWe measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Other marketable securities were valued either based on recent trades of securities in inactive markets or based on quoted market prices of similar instruments and other significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. We did not hold significant amounts of marketable securities categorized as Level 3 assets as of December 31, 2022 and 2023. \n\nWe hold equity warrants giving us the right to acquire stock of other companies. As of December 31, 2022 and 2023, these warrants had a fair value of $ 2.1 billion and $ 2.2 billion, and are recorded within &#8220; Other assets &#8221; on our consolidated balance sheets with gains and losses recognized in &#8220;Other income (expense), net&#8221; on our consolidated statements of operations. These warrants are classified as Level 2 and 3 assets. \n\nCash and Cash Equivalents \n\nWe classify all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents. \n\nInventories \n\nInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in, first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. The inventory valuation allowance, representing a write-down of inventory, was $ 2.8 billion and $ 3.0 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2023. \n\nWe provide Fulfillment by Amazon services in connection with certain of our sellers&#8217; programs. Third-party sellers maintain ownership of their inventory, regardless of whether fulfillment is provided by us or the third-party sellers, and therefore these products are not included in our inventories. \n\nWe also purchase electronic device components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers for certain electronic device components. We have certain non-cancellable purchase commitments arising from these agreements. These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs. We also have firm, non-cancellable commitments for certain products offered in our Whole Foods Market stores. \n\nAccounts Receivable, Net and Other \n\nIncluded in &#8220;Accounts receivable, net and other&#8221; on our consolidated balance sheets are receivables primarily related to customers, vendors, and sellers, as well as prepaid expenses and other current assets. As of December 31, 2022 and 2023, customer receivables, net, were $ 26.6 billion and $ 34.1 billion, vendor receivables, net, were $ 6.9 billion and $ 8.5 billion, seller receivables, net, were $ 1.3 billion and $ 1.0 billion, and other receivables, net, were $ 3.1 billion and $ 3.3 billion. Seller receivables are amounts due from sellers related to our seller lending program, which provides funding to sellers primarily to procure inventory. Prepaid expenses and other current assets were $ 4.5 billion and $ 5.4 billion as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023. \n\nWe estimate losses on receivables based on expected losses, including our historical experience of actual losses. Receivables are considered impaired and written-off when it is probable that all contractual payments due will not be collected in accordance with the terms of the agreement. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $ 1.1 billion, $ 1.4 billion, and $ 1.7 billion as of December 31, 2021, 2022, and 2023. Additions to the allowance were $ 1.0 billion, $ 1.6 billion, and $ 1.9 billion, and deductions to the allowance were $ 1.1 billion, $ 1.3 billion, and $ 1.6 billion in 2021, 2022, and 2023. \n\nSoftware Development Costs \n\nWe incur software development costs related to products to be sold, leased, or marketed to external users, internal-use software, and our websites. Software development costs capitalized were not significant for the years presented. All other costs, including those related to design or maintenance, are expensed as incurred. \n\nProperty and Equipment, Net \n\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Incentives that we receive from property and equipment vendors are recorded as a reduction to our costs. Property includes buildings and land that we own, along with property we have acquired under build-to-suit lease arrangements when we have control over the building during the construction period and finance lease arrangements. Equipment includes assets such as servers and networking equipment, heavy equipment, and other fulfillment equipment. Depreciation and amortization is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets (generally the lesser of 40 years or the remaining life of the underlying building, four years prior to January 1, 2022 and five years subsequent to January 1, 2022 for our servers, five years prior to January 1, 2022 and six years subsequent to January 1, 2022 for our networking equipment, ten years for heavy equipment, and three to ten years for other fulfillment equipment). Depreciation and amortization expense is classified within the corresponding operating expense categories on our consolidated statements of operations. \n\nLeases \n\nWe categorize leases with contractual terms longer than twelve months as either operating or finance. Finance leases are generally those leases that allow us to substantially utilize or pay for the entire asset over its estimated life. Assets acquired under finance leases are recorded in &#8220;Property and equipment, net.&#8221; All other leases are categorized as operating leases. Our leases generally have terms that range from one to ten years for equipment and one to twenty years for property. \n\nCertain lease contracts include obligations to pay for other services, such as operations and maintenance. For leases of property, we account for these other services as a component of the lease. For substantially all other leases, the services are accounted for separately and we allocate payments to the lease and other services components based on estimated stand-alone prices. \n\nLease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the fixed lease payments, reduced by landlord incentives using a discount rate based on similarly secured borrowings available to us. Lease assets are recognized based on the initial present value of the fixed lease payments, reduced by landlord incentives, plus any direct costs from executing the leases or lease prepayments reclassified from &#8220;Other assets&#8221; upon lease commencement. Leasehold improvements are capitalized at cost and amortized over the lesser of their expected useful life or the lease term. \n\nWhen we have the option to extend the lease term, terminate the lease before the contractual expiration date, or purchase the leased asset, and it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the option, we consider the option in determining the classification and measurement of the lease. Our leases may include variable payments based on measures that include changes in price indices, market interest rates, or the level of sales at a physical store, which are expensed as incurred. \n\nCosts associated with operating lease assets are recognized on a straight-line basis within operating expenses over the term of the lease. Finance lease assets are amortized within operating expenses on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or, in the instance where title does not transfer at the end of the lease term, the lease term. The interest component of a finance lease is included in interest expense and recognized using the effective interest method over the lease term. \n\nWe establish assets and liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to retire long-lived assets at the termination or expiration of a lease. Such assets are amortized over the lease period into operating expense, and the recorded liabilities are accreted to the future value of the estimated retirement costs. \n\nFinancing Obligations \n\nWe record assets and liabilities for estimated construction costs under build-to-suit lease arrangements when we have control over the building during the construction period. If we continue to control the building after the construction period, the arrangement is classified as a financing obligation instead of a lease. The building is depreciated over the shorter of its useful life or the term of the obligation. \n\nIf we do not control the building after the construction period ends, the assets and liabilities for construction costs are derecognized, and we classify the lease as operating. \n\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets \n\nWe evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value and if so, we perform a quantitative test. We compare the carrying value of each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset to its estimated fair value and if the fair value is determined to be less than the carrying value, we recognize an impairment loss for the difference. We estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses, based primarily on expected category expansion, pricing, market segment share, and general economic conditions. \n\nWe completed the required annual impairment test of goodwill for all reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets as of April 1, 2023, resulting in no impairments. The fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value. There were no events that caused us to update our annual impairment test. See &#8220;Note 5 &#8212; Acquisitions, Goodwill, and Acquired Intangible Assets.&#8221; \n\nOther Assets \n\nIncluded in &#8220;Other assets&#8221; on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to video and music content, net of accumulated amortization; long-term deferred tax assets; acquired intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization; equity warrant assets and certain equity investments; satellite network launch services deposits; and affordable housing loans. We recognize certain transactions with governments when there is reasonable assurance that incentives included in the agreements, such as cash or certain tax credits, will be received and we are able to comply with any related conditions. These incentives are recorded as reductions to the cost of related assets or expenses. \n\nDigital Video and Music Content \n\nWe obtain video content, inclusive of episodic television and movies, and music content for customers through licensing agreements that have a wide range of licensing provisions including both fixed and variable payment schedules. When the license fee for a specific video or music title is determinable or reasonably estimable and the content is available to us, we recognize an asset and a corresponding liability for the amounts owed. We reduce the liability as payments are made and we amortize the asset to &#8220;Cost of sales&#8221; on an accelerated basis, based on estimated usage or viewing patterns, or on a straight-line basis. If the licensing fee is not determinable or reasonably estimable, no asset or liability is recorded and licensing costs are expensed as incurred. We also develop original video content for which the production costs are capitalized and amortized to &#8220;Cost of sales&#8221; predominantly on an accelerated basis that follows the estimated viewing patterns associated with the content. The weighted average remaining life of our capitalized video content is 3.5 years. We review usage and viewing patterns impacting the amortization of capitalized video content on an ongoing basis and reflect any changes prospectively. \n\nOur produced and licensed video content is primarily monetized together as a unit, referred to as a film group, in each major geography where we offer Amazon Prime memberships. These film groups are evaluated for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change indicating the fair value is less than the carrying value. The total capitalized costs of video, which is primarily released content, and music as of December 31, 2022 and 2023 were $ 16.7 billion and $ 17.4 billion. Total video and music expense was $ 16.6 billion and $ 18.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2023. Total video and music expense includes licensing and production costs associated with content offered within Amazon Prime memberships, and costs associated with digital subscriptions and sold or rented content. \n\nInvestments \n\nWe generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term marketable debt securities. Such investments are included in &#8220;Cash and cash equivalents&#8221; or &#8220;Marketable securities&#8221; on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. \n\nMarketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in &#8220;Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).&#8221; Each reporting period, we evaluate whether declines in fair value below carrying value are due to expected credit losses, as well as our ability and intent to hold the investment until a forecasted recovery occurs. Expected credit losses are recorded as an allowance through &#8220;Other income (expense), net&#8221; on our consolidated statements of operations. \n\nConvertible notes classified as available for sale, equity investments in private companies for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence and accounted for at cost, and equity investments accounted for using the equity method of accounting are included within &#8220;Other assets&#8221; on our consolidated balance sheets. \n\nIn Q3 2023, we invested in a $ 1.25 billion note from Anthropic, PBC, which is convertible to equity. The note is classified as available for sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in &#8220;Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).&#8221; The note is classified as a Level 3 asset. We have an agreement that expires in Q1 2024 to invest up to an additional $ 2.75 billion in a second convertible note. We also have a commercial arrangement primarily for the provision of AWS cloud services, which includes the use of AWS chips. \n\nEquity investments in private companies for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for at cost, with adjustments for observable changes in prices or impairments, with adjustments recognized in &#8220;Other income (expense), net&#8221; on our consolidated statements of operations. Each reporting period, we perform a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether the investment is impaired. Our assessment includes a review of recent operating results and trends, recent sales/acquisitions of the investee securities, and other publicly available data. If the investment is impaired, we write it down to its estimated fair value. As of December 31, 2022 and 2023, these investments had a carrying value of $ 715 million and $ 754 million. \n\nEquity investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, or at fair value if we elect the fair value option, if the investment gives us the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over an investee. Our share of the earnings or losses as reported by equity-method investees, amortization of basis differences, related gains or losses, and impairments, if any, are recognized in &#8220;Equity-method investment activity, net of tax&#8221; on our consolidated statements of operations. Each reporting period, we evaluate whether declines in fair value below carrying value are other-than-temporary and if so, we write down the investment to its estimated fair value. \n\nEquity investments that have readily determinable fair values, including investments for which we have elected the fair value option, are included in &#8220;Marketable securities&#8221; on our consolidated balance sheets and measured at fair value with changes recognized in &#8220;Other income (expense), net&#8221; on our consolidated statements of operations. \n\nLong-Lived Assets \n\nLong-lived assets, other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or any other significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. \n\nFor long-lived assets used in operations, including lease assets, impairment losses are only recorded if the asset&#8217;s carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted, probability-weighted future cash flows. We measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value. Long-lived assets are considered held for sale when certain criteria are met, including when management has committed to a plan to sell the asset, the asset is available for sale in its immediate condition, and the sale is probable within one year of the reporting date. Assets held for sale are reported at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell. Assets held for sale were not significant as of December 31, 2022 and 2023. \n\nAccrued Expenses and Other \n\nIncluded in &#8220;Accrued expenses and other&#8221; on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities primarily related to leases and asset retirement obligations, tax-related liabilities, current debt, payroll and related expenses, unredeemed gift cards, self-insurance liabilities, customer liabilities, marketing liabilities, acquired digital media content, and other operating expenses. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2023, our liabilities for payroll related expenses were $ 7.7 billion and our liabilities for unredeemed gift cards were $ 5.4 billion and $ 5.3 billion. We reduce the liability for a gift card when redeemed by a customer. The portion of gift cards that we do not expect to be redeemed is recognized based on customer usage patterns. \n\nSelf-Insurance Liabilities \n\nAlthough we maintain certain high-deductible, third-party insurance coverage for catastrophic losses, we effectively self-insure for exposure primarily related to workers&#8217; compensation, employee health care benefits, general and product liability, and automobile liability, including liability resulting from third-party transportation service providers. We estimate self-insurance liabilities by considering historical claims experience, frequency and costs of claims, projected claims development, inflation, and other actuarial assumptions. Changes in the number or costs of claims, healthcare costs, judgment and settlement amounts, associated legal expenses, and other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from these estimates. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we increased our reserves for general, product, and automobile liabilities by $ 1.3 billion primarily driven by changes in our estimates about the costs of asserted and unasserted claims, which was primarily recorded in &#8220;Cost of sales&#8221; on our consolidated statements of operations and impacted our North America segment. Increases to our reserves driven by changes in estimates were not material to our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and \n\n2023. As of December 31, 2022 and 2023, our total self-insurance liabilities were $ 4.0 billion and $ 6.3 billion and are included in &#8220;Accrued expenses and other&#8221; on our consolidated balance sheets. \n\nUnearned Revenue \n\nUnearned revenue is recorded when payments are received or due in advance of performing our service obligations and is recognized over the service period. Unearned revenue primarily relates to prepayments of AWS services and Amazon Prime memberships. Our total unearned revenue as of December 31, 2022 was $ 16.1 billion, of which $ 12.4 billion was recognized as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2023 and our total unearned revenue as of December 31, 2023 was $ 20.6 billion. Included in &#8220;Other long-term liabilities&#8221; on our consolidated balance sheets was $ 2.9 billion and $ 5.7 billion of unearned revenue as of December 31, 2022 and 2023. \n\nAdditionally, we have performance obligations, primarily related to AWS, associated with commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized in our financial statements. For contracts with original terms that exceed one year, those commitments not yet recognized were $ 155.7 billion as of December 31, 2023. The weighted average remaining life of our long-term contracts is 4.0 years. However, the amount and timing of revenue recognition is largely driven by customer usage, which can extend beyond the original contractual term. \n\nOther Long-Term Liabilities \n\nIncluded in &#8220;Other long-term liabilities&#8221; on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities primarily related to financing obligations, unearned revenue, asset retirement obligations, tax contingencies, digital video and music content, and deferred tax liabilities. \n\nForeign Currency \n\nWe have internationally-focused stores for which the net sales generated, as well as most of the related expenses directly incurred from those operations, are denominated in local functional currencies. The functional currency of our subsidiaries that either operate or support these stores is generally the same as the local currency. Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars at period-end foreign exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing throughout the period. Translation adjustments are included in &#8220;Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),&#8221; a separate component of stockholders&#8217; equity. Transaction gains and losses including intercompany transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity involved are included in &#8220;Other income (expense), net&#8221; on our consolidated statements of operations. In connection with the settlement and remeasurement of intercompany balances, we recorded gains (losses) of $ 19 million, $ 386 million, and $( 329 ) million in 2021, 2022, and 2023. \n\nAccounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted \n\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an Accounting Standards Update (&#8220;ASU&#8221;) amending existing income tax disclosure guidance, primarily requiring more detailed disclosure for income taxes paid and the effective tax rate reconciliation. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted and can be applied on either a prospective or retroactive basis. We are currently evaluating the ASU to determine its impact on our income tax disclosures. \n\nNote 2 &#8212; FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \n\nCash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash, and Marketable Securities \n\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2023, our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities primarily consisted of cash, AAA-rated money market funds, U.S. and foreign government and agency securities, other investment grade securities, and marketable equity securities. Cash equivalents and marketable securities are recorded at fair value.

We also assumed $ 2.5 billion of debt, which we repaid immediately after closing. The acquired assets primarily consist of $ 3.4 billion of video content and $ 4.9 billion of goodwill. \n\nDuring 2022, we also acquired certain other companies for an aggregate purchase price of $ 141 million, net of cash acquired. \n\n2023 Acquisition Activity \n\nOn February 22, 2023, we acquired 1Life Healthcare, Inc. (One Medical), for cash consideration of approximately $ 3.5 billion, net of cash acquired, to provide health care options for customers. The acquired assets primarily consist of $ 1.3 billion of intangible assets and $ 2.5 billion of goodwill, which is allocated to our North America segment. \n\nDuring 2023, we also acquired certain other companies for an immaterial aggregate purchase price, net of cash acquired. \n\nPro forma results of operations have not been presented because the effects of the 2023 acquisitions, individually and in the aggregate, were not material to our consolidated results of operations. Acquisition-related costs were expensed as incurred and were not significant. \n\nIn addition, in August 2022, we entered into an agreement to acquire iRobot Corporation, as amended in July 2023, for approximately $ 1.7 billion, including its debt, subject to customary closing conditions. In January 2024, we and iRobot agreed to terminate the transaction. \n\nGoodwill \n\nThe goodwill of the acquired companies is primarily related to expected improvements in technology performance and functionality, as well as sales growth from future product and service offerings and new customers, together with certain intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition. The goodwill of the acquired companies is generally not deductible for tax purposes.

In addition, we had $ 6.8 billion of unused letters of credit as of December 31, 2023. \n\nNote 7 &#8212; COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES \n\nCommitments \n\nThe following summarizes our principal contractual commitments, excluding open orders for purchases that support normal operations and are generally cancellable, as of December 31, 2023 (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Year Ended December 31, &#160; &#160; &#160; 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 Thereafter Total Long-term debt principal and interest $ 10,616 &#160; $ 7,175 &#160; $ 4,858 &#160; $ 10,404 &#160; $ 3,643 &#160; $ 60,176 &#160; $ 96,872 &#160; Operating lease liabilities 11,229 &#160; 9,922 &#160; 9,156 &#160; 8,321 &#160; 7,546 &#160; 44,603 &#160; 90,777 &#160; Finance lease liabilities, including interest 2,292 &#160; 1,471 &#160; 1,369 &#160; 1,123 &#160; 1,022 &#160; 6,829 &#160; 14,106 &#160; Financing obligations, including interest (1) 469 &#160; 462 &#160; 468 &#160; 476 &#160; 484 &#160; 6,282 &#160; 8,641 &#160; Leases not yet commenced 2,034 &#160; 2,620 &#160; 2,836 &#160; 2,852 &#160; 2,979 &#160; 24,860 &#160; 38,181 &#160; Unconditional purchase obligations (2) 9,432 &#160; 7,823 &#160; 5,901 &#160; 4,463 &#160; 1,912 &#160; 5,953 &#160; 35,484 &#160; Other commitments (3) 3,273 &#160; 1,390 &#160; 1,125 &#160; 759 &#160; 680 &#160; 9,121 &#160; 16,348 &#160; Total commitments $ 39,345 &#160; $ 30,863 &#160; $ 25,713 &#160; $ 28,398 &#160; $ 18,266 &#160; $ 157,824 &#160; $ 300,409 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n___________________ \n\n(1) Includes non-cancellable financing obligations for fulfillment network and data center facilities. Excluding interest, current financing obligations of $ 266 million and $ 271 million are recorded within &#8220;Accrued expenses and other&#8221; and $ 6.7 billion and $ 6.6 billion are recorded within &#8220;Other long-term liabilities&#8221; as of December 31, 2022 and 2023. The weighted-average remaining term of the financing obligations was 17.9 years and 17.0 years and the weighted-average imputed interest rate was 3.1 % as of December 31, 2022 and 2023. \n\n(2) Includes unconditional purchase obligations related to long-term agreements to acquire and license digital media content that are not reflected on the consolidated balance sheets, and certain products offered in our Whole Foods Market stores. For those digital media content agreements with variable terms, we do not estimate the total obligation beyond any minimum quantities and/or pricing as of the reporting date. Purchase obligations associated with renewal provisions solely at the option of the content provider are included to the extent such commitments are fixed or a minimum amount is specified. Renewable energy agreements based on actual generation without a fixed or minimum volume commitment are not included. These agreements also provide the right to receive renewable energy certificates for no additional consideration. \n\n(3) Includes asset retirement obligations, liabilities associated with digital media content agreements with initial terms greater than one year, and the estimated timing and amounts of payments for rent and tenant improvements associated with build-to-suit lease arrangements that are under construction. Excludes approximately $ 5.2 billion of income tax contingencies for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of payment, if any. \n\nSuppliers \n\nDuring 2023, no vendor accounted for 10% or more of our purchases. We generally do not have long-term contracts or arrangements with our vendors to guarantee the availability of merchandise, particular payment terms, or the extension of credit limits. \n\nOther Contingencies \n\nWe are disputing claims and denials of refunds or credits, and monitoring or evaluating potential claims, related to various non-income taxes (such as sales, value added, consumption, service, and similar taxes), including in jurisdictions in which we already collect and remit these taxes. These non-income tax controversies typically include (i) the taxability of products and services, including cross-border intercompany transactions, (ii) collection and withholding on transactions with third parties, including as a result of evolving requirements imposed on marketplaces with respect to third-party sellers, and (iii) the adequacy of compliance with reporting obligations, including evolving documentation requirements. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of these matters and the judicial and regulatory processes in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome of any such controversies may be materially different from our expectations. \n\nLegal Proceedings \n\nThe Company is involved from time to time in claims, proceedings, and litigation, including the following: \n\nIn November 2015, Eolas Technologies, Inc. filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The complaint alleges, among other things, that the use of &#8220;interactive features&#8221; on www.amazon.com, including &#8220;search suggestions and search results,&#8221; infringes U.S. Patent No. 9,195,507, entitled &#8220;Distributed \n\nHypermedia Method and System for Automatically Invoking External Application Providing Interaction and Display of Embedded Objects Within a Hypermedia Document.&#8221; The complaint sought a judgment of infringement together with costs and attorneys&#8217; fees. In February 2016, Eolas filed an amended complaint seeking, among other things, an unspecified amount of damages. In February 2017, Eolas alleged in its damages report that in the event of a finding of liability Amazon could be subject to $ 130 million to $ 250 million in damages. In April 2017, the case was transferred to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. In May 2022, the district court granted summary judgment, holding that the patent is invalid. In June 2022, Eolas filed a notice of appeal. In February 2024, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the district court&#8217;s judgment. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. \n\nIn May 2018, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and CF Dynamic Advances LLC filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York. The complaint alleges, among other things, that &#8220;Alexa Voice Software and Alexa enabled devices&#8221; infringe U.S. Patent No. 7,177,798, entitled &#8220;Natural Language Interface Using Constrained Intermediate Dictionary of Results.&#8221; The complaint seeks an injunction, an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages , an ongoing royalty, interest, attorneys&#8217; fees, and costs. In March 2023, the plaintiffs alleged in their damages report that in the event of a finding of liability Amazon could be subject to $ 140 million to $ 267 million in damages. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. \n\nIn December 2018, Kove IO, Inc. filed a complaint against Amazon Web Services, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The complaint alleges, among other things, that Amazon S3 and DynamoDB infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 7,814,170 and 7,103,640, each entitled &#8220;Network Distributed Tracking Wire Transfer Protocol&#8221;; and 7,233,978, entitled &#8220;Method and Apparatus for Managing Location Information in a Network Separate from the Data to Which the Location Information Pertains.&#8221; The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages, attorneys&#8217; fees, costs, interest, and injunctive relief. In March 2022, the case was stayed pending resolution of review petitions we filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. In November 2022, the stay was lifted. In July 2023, Kove alleged in its damages report that in the event of a finding of liability Amazon Web Services could be subject to $ 517 million to $ 1.03 billion in damages. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. \n\nBeginning in June 2019 with Wilcosky v. Amazon.com, Inc., now pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois (&#8220;N.D. Ill.&#8221;), private litigants have filed a number of cases in U.S. federal and state courts, including Hogan v. Amazon.com, Inc. (N.D. Ill.), alleging, among other things, that Amazon&#8217;s collection, storage, use, retention, and protection of biometric identifiers violated the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act. The complaints allege purported classes of Illinois residents who had biometric identifiers collected through Amazon products or services, including Amazon Photos, Alexa, AWS cloud services, Ring, Amazon Connect, Amazon&#8217;s Flex driver app, and Amazon&#8217;s virtual try-on technology. The complaints seek certification as class actions, unspecified amounts of damages, injunctive relief, attorneys&#8217; fees, costs, and interest. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters. \n\nBeginning in March 2020 with Frame-Wilson v. Amazon.com, Inc. filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington (&#8220;W.D. Wash.&#8221;), private litigants have filed a number of cases in the U.S. and Canada alleging, among other things, price fixing arrangements between Amazon.com, Inc. and vendors and third-party sellers in Amazon&#8217;s stores, monopolization and attempted monopolization, and consumer protection and unjust enrichment claims. Attorneys General for the District of Columbia and California brought similar suits in May 2021 and September 2022 in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia and the California Superior Court for the County of San Francisco, respectively. Some of the private cases include allegations of several distinct purported classes, including consumers who purchased a product through Amazon&#8217;s stores and consumers who purchased a product offered by Amazon through another e-commerce retailer. The complaints seek billions of dollars of alleged damages, treble damages, punitive damages, injunctive relief, civil penalties, attorneys&#8217; fees, and costs. The Federal Trade Commission and a number of state Attorneys General filed a similar lawsuit in September 2023 in the W.D. Wash. alleging violations of federal antitrust and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. That complaint alleges, among other things, that Amazon has a monopoly in markets for online superstores and marketplace services, and unlawfully maintains those monopolies through anticompetitive practices relating to our pricing policies, advertising practices, the structure of Prime, and promotion of our own products on our website. The complaint seeks injunctive and structural relief, an unspecified amount of damages, and costs. Amazon&#8217;s motions to dismiss were granted in part and denied in part in Frame-Wilson in March 2022 and March 2023, De Coster v. Amazon.com, Inc. (W.D. Wash.) in January 2023, and the California Attorney General&#8217;s lawsuit in March 2023. All three courts dismissed claims alleging that Amazon&#8217;s pricing policies are inherently illegal and denied dismissal of claims alleging that Amazon&#8217;s pricing policies are an unlawful restraint of trade. In March 2022, the DC Superior Court dismissed the DC Attorney General&#8217;s lawsuit in its entirety; the dismissal is under appeal. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters. \n\nIn October 2020, Broadband iTV, Inc. filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc., Amazon.com Services LLC, and Amazon Web Services, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. The complaint alleges, among other things, that certain Amazon Prime Video features and services infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 9,648,388, 10,546,750, and 10,536,751, each entitled &#8220;Video-On-Demand Content Delivery System for Providing Video-On-Demand Services to TV \n\nServices Subscribers&#8221;; 10,028,026, entitled &#8220;System for Addressing On-Demand TV Program Content on TV Services Platform of a Digital TV Services Provider&#8221;; and 9,973,825, entitled &#8220;Dynamic Adjustment of Electronic Program Guide Displays Based on Viewer Preferences for Minimizing Navigation in VOD Program Selection.&#8221; The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages. In April 2022, Broadband iTV alleged in its damages report that in the event of a finding of liability Amazon could be subject to $ 166 million to $ 986 million in damages. In September 2022, the court granted summary judgment, holding that the patents are invalid. In October 2022, Broadband iTV filed a notice of appeal. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. \n\nIn July 2021, the Luxembourg National Commission for Data Protection (the &#8220;CNPD&#8221;) issued a decision against Amazon Europe Core S.&#224; r.l. claiming that Amazon&#8217;s processing of personal data did not comply with the EU General Data Protection Regulation. The decision imposes a fine of &#8364; 746 million and corresponding practice revisions. We believe the CNPD&#8217;s decision to be without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. \n\nIn December 2021, the Italian Competition Authority (the &#8220;ICA&#8221;) issued a decision against Amazon Services Europe S.&#224; r.l., Amazon Europe Core S.&#224; r.l., Amazon EU S.&#224; r.l., Amazon Italia Services S.r.l., and Amazon Italia Logistica S.r.l. claiming that certain of our marketplace and logistics practices in Italy infringe EU competition rules. The decision imposes remedial actions and a fine of &#8364; 1.13 billion, which we have paid and will seek to recover pending conclusion of all appeals. We believe the ICA&#8217;s decision to be without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. \n\nIn July 2022, Acceleration Bay, LLC filed a complaint against Amazon Web Services, Inc. in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. The complaint alleges, among other things, that Amazon EC2, Amazon CloudFront, AWS Lambda, Amazon Lumberyard, Luna, Amazon Prime Video, Twitch, Amazon GameLift, GridMate, Amazon EKS, AWS App Mesh, and Amazon VPC infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 6,701,344, entitled &#8220;Distributed Game Environment&#8221;; 6,714,966, entitled &#8220;Information Delivery Service&#8221;; 6,732,147, entitled &#8220;Leaving a Broadcast Channel&#8221;; 6,829,634, entitled &#8220;Broadcasting Network&#8221;; and 6,910,069, entitled &#8220;Joining a Broadcast Channel.&#8221; The complaint seeks injunctive relief, an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages, interest, attorneys&#8217; fees, and costs. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. \n\nIn November 2022, LightGuide, Inc. filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. and Amazon.com Services LLC in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The complaint alleges, among other things, that Amazon&#8217;s Nike Intent Detection System used in certain fulfillment centers infringes U.S. Patent Nos. 7,515,981, entitled &#8220;Light Guided Assembly System&#8221;; and 9,658,614 and 10,528,036, each entitled &#8220;Light Guided Assembly System and Method.&#8221; The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages, attorneys&#8217; fees, costs, interest, and injunctive relief. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. \n\nIn May 2023, Dialect, LLC filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. and Amazon Web Services, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Eastern District for Virginia. The complaint alleges, among other things, that Amazon&#8217;s Alexa-enabled products and services, such as Echo devices, Fire tablets, Fire TV sticks, Fire TVs, Alexa, and Alexa Voice Services, infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 7,693,720 and 9,031,845, each entitled &#8220;Mobile Systems and Methods for Responding to Natural Language Speech Utterance&#8221;; 8,015,006, entitled &#8220;Systems and Methods for Processing Natural Language Speech Utterances with Context-Specific Domain Agents&#8221;; 8,140,327, entitled &#8220;System and Method for Filtering and Eliminating Noise from Natural Language Utterances to Improve Speech Recognition and Parsing&#8221;; 8,195,468 and 9,495,957, each entitled &#8220;Mobile Systems and Methods of Supporting Natural Language Human-Machine Interactions&#8221;; and 9,263,039, entitled &#8220;Systems and Methods for Responding to Natural Language Speech Utterance.&#8221; The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages, attorneys&#8217; fees, costs, interest, and injunctive relief. In November 2023, the court granted in part Amazon&#8217;s motion to dismiss Dialect&#8217;s complaint and dismissed the &#8216;845 patent from the case. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. \n\nBeginning in October 2023, Nokia Technologies Oy and related entities filed complaints alleging infringement of patents related to video-related technologies against Amazon.com, Inc. and related entities in multiple courts in the United States, India, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Brazil, the Unified Patent Court of the European Union, and the United States International Trade Commission. The complaints allege, among other things, that certain Amazon Prime Video services and features of Amazon devices carrying the Prime Video app infringe Nokia&#8217;s patents; some of the complaints additionally allege infringement by Freevee, Twitch, and Amazon voice assistants. The complaints seek, among other things, injunctive relief and, in some cases, unspecified money damages, enhanced damages, attorneys&#8217; fees, costs, interest, and declaratory relief. These matters are at various procedural stages, with preliminary injunctions issued in certain instances. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters. \n\nIn addition, we are regularly subject to claims, li tigation, and other proceedings, including potential regulatory proceedings, involving patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, privacy and data protection, consumer protection, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third parties, and other matters. \n\nThe outcomes of our legal proceedings and other contingencies are inherently unpredictable, subject to significant uncertainties, and could be material to our operating results and cash flows for a particular period. We evaluate, on a regular basis, developments in our legal proceedings and other contingencies that could affect the amount of liability, including amounts in excess of any previous accruals and reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments and changes to our accruals and disclosures as appropriate. For the matters we disclose that do not include an estimate of the amount of loss or range of losses, such an estimate is not possible or is immaterial, and we may be unable to estimate the possible loss or range of losses that could potentially result from the application of non-monetary remedies. Until the final resolution of such matters, if any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, we may experience losses in excess of the amounts recorded, which could have a material effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. \n\nSee also &#8220;Note 9 &#8212; Income Taxes.&#8221; \n\nNote 8 &#8212; STOCKHOLDERS&#8217; EQUITY \n\nPreferred Stock \n\nWe have authorized 500 million shares of $ 0.01 par value preferred stock. No preferred stock was outstanding for any year presented. \n\nCommon Stock \n\nCommon shares outstanding plus shares underlying outstanding stock awards totaled 10.5 billion, 10.6 billion, and 10.8 billion, as of December 31, 2021, 2022, and 2023. These totals include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding, including those awards we estimate will be forfeited. \n\nStock Repurchase Activity \n\nIn March 2022, the Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $ 10.0 billion of our common stock, with no fixed expiration, which replaced the previous $ 5.0 billion stock repurchase authorization, approved by the Board of Directors in February 2016. We repurchased 46.2 million shares of our common stock for $ 6.0 billion in 2022 under these programs. There were no repurchases of common stock in 2021 or 2023. As of December 31, 2023, we have $ 6.1 billion remaining under the repurchase program. \n\nStock Award Plans \n\nEmployees vest in restricted stock unit awards over the corresponding service term, generally between two and five years . The majority of restricted stock unit awards are granted at the date of hire or in Q2 as part of the annual compensation review and primarily vest semi-annually in Q2 and Q4 of the relevant compensation year. \n\nStock Award Activity \n\nStock-based compensation expense is as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Year Ended December 31, 2021 2022 2023 Cost of sales $ 540 &#160; $ 757 &#160; $ 836 &#160; Fulfillment 1,946 &#160; 2,745 &#160; 3,090 &#160; Technology and infrastructure 6,645 &#160; 10,621 &#160; 13,434 &#160; Sales and marketing 2,530 &#160; 3,875 &#160; 4,623 &#160; General and administrative 1,096 &#160; 1,623 &#160; 2,040 &#160; Total stock-based compensation expense (1) $ 12,757 &#160; $ 19,621 &#160; $ 24,023 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n___________________ \n\n(1) The related tax benefits were $ 2.7 billion, $ 4.3 billion, and $ 5.4 billion for 2021, 2022, and 2023. \n\nThe following table summarizes our restricted stock unit activity (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START Number of Units Weighted Average Grant-Date Fair Value Outstanding as of January 1, 2021 303.3 &#160; $ 100 &#160; Units granted 127.3 &#160; 167 &#160; Units vested ( 108.4 ) 85 &#160; Units forfeited ( 42.3 ) 116 &#160; Outstanding as of December 31, 2021 279.9 &#160; 134 &#160; Units granted 262.8 &#160; 142 &#160; Units vested ( 113.3 ) 114 &#160; Units forfeited ( 45.0 ) 143 &#160; Outstanding as of December 31, 2022 384.4 &#160; 144 &#160; Units granted 218.1 &#160; 106 &#160; Units vested ( 139.9 ) 143 &#160; Units forfeited ( 56.8 ) 135 &#160; Outstanding as of December 31, 2023 405.8 &#160; 125 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nScheduled vesting for outstanding restricted stock units as of December 31, 2023, is as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; Year Ended &#160; &#160; &#160; 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 Thereafter Total Scheduled vesting &#8212; restricted stock units 218.3 &#160; 124.6 &#160; 48.7 &#160; 11.2 &#160; 1.3 &#160; 1.7 &#160; 405.8 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, there was $ 18.3 billion of net unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock-based compensation arrangements. This compensation is recognized on an accelerated basis with more than half of the compensation expected to be expensed in the next twelve months, and has a remaining weighted-average recognition period of 0.9 years. The estimated forfeiture rate as of December 31, 2021, 2022, and 2023 was 26.5 %, 26.5 %, and 26.1 %. \n\nDuring 2021, 2022, and 2023, the fair value of restricted stock units that vested was $ 18.2 billion, $ 12.8 billion, and $ 17.6 billion. \n\nCommon Stock Available for Future Issuance \n\nAs of December 31, 2023, common stock available for future issuance to employees is 1.6 billion shares. \n\nNote 9 &#8212; INCOME TAXES \n\nIn 2021, 2022, and 2023, we recorded a net tax provision (benefit) of $ 4.8 billion, $( 3.2 ) billion, and $ 7.1 billion. Our U.S. taxable income is reduced by accelerated depreciation deductions and increased by the impact of capitalized research and development expenses. Cash paid for income taxes, net of refunds, was $ 3.7 billion, $ 6.0 billion, and $ 11.2 billion for 2021, 2022, and 2023. \n\nCertain foreign subsidiary earnings and losses are subject to current U.S. taxation and the subsequent repatriation of those earnings is not subject to tax in the U.S. The U.S. tax rules also provide for enhanced accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing us to expense a portion of qualified property, primarily equipment. These enhanced deductions are scheduled to phase out annually from 2023 through 2026. Our federal tax provision included a partial accelerated depreciation deduction election for 2021, and a full election for 2022 and 2023.

Our tax provision includes $ 1.9 billion of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation for 2021, and $ 33 million and $ 519 million of tax shortfalls from stock-based compensation for 2022 and 2023. \n\n(2) U.S. companies are eligible for a deduction that lowers the effective tax rate on certain foreign income. This regime is referred to as the Foreign-Derived Intangible Income deduction and is dependent on the amount of our U.S. taxable income. \n\nWe generated an income tax benefit in 2022 as compared to a provision for income taxes in 2021 primarily due to a decrease in pretax income and an increase in the foreign income deduction. This was partially offset by a reduction in excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and a decrease in the tax impact of foreign earnings and losses driven by a decline in the favorable effects of corporate restructuring transactions. The foreign income deduction benefit recognized in 2022 reflects a change in our application of tax regulations related to the computation of qualifying foreign income and includes a tax benefit of approximately $ 655 million related to years prior to 2022. \n\nWe recorded a provision for income taxes in 2023 as compared to an income tax benefit in 2022 primarily due to an increase in pretax income, a decrease in the tax impact of foreign earnings and losses driven by a decline in the favorable effects of corporate restructuring transactions, and an increase in tax shortfalls from stock-based compensation. This was partially offset by an increase in federal research and development credits, which included approximately $ 600 million of tax benefit recorded in 2023 related to a change in the estimated qualifying expenditures associated with our 2022 U.S. federal R&#38;D credit. \n\nWe intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts. \n\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; December 31, &#160; 2022 2023 Deferred tax assets (1): Loss carryforwards U.S. - Federal/States 386 &#160; 610 &#160; Loss carryforwards - Foreign 2,831 &#160; 2,796 &#160; Accrued liabilities, reserves, and other expenses 3,280 &#160; 3,751 &#160; Stock-based compensation 4,295 &#160; 5,279 &#160; Depreciation and amortization 1,009 &#160; 1,114 &#160; Operating lease liabilities 18,285 &#160; 19,922 &#160; Capitalized research and development 6,824 &#160; 14,800 &#160; Other items 1,023 &#160; 745 &#160; Tax credits 950 &#160; 1,582 &#160; Total gross deferred tax assets 38,883 &#160; 50,599 &#160; Less valuation allowances (2) ( 4,374 ) ( 4,811 ) Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances 34,509 &#160; 45,788 &#160; Deferred tax liabilities: Depreciation and amortization ( 9,039 ) ( 12,454 ) Operating lease assets ( 17,140 ) ( 18,648 ) Other items ( 817 ) ( 1,489 ) Net deferred tax assets (liabilities), net of valuation allowances $ 7,513 &#160; $ 13,197 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;___________________ \n\n(1) Deferred tax assets are presented after tax effects and net of tax contingencies. \n\n(2) Relates primarily to deferred tax assets that would only be realizable upon the generation of net income in certain foreign taxing jurisdictions or future capital gains, as well as tax credits. \n\nOur valuation allowances primarily relate to foreign deferred tax assets, including substantially all of our foreign net operating loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2023. Our foreign net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes as of December 31, 2023 were approximately $ 10.2 billion before tax effects and certain of these amounts are subject to annual limitations under applicable tax law. If not utilized, a portion of these losses will begin to expire in 2024. \n\nIncome Tax Contingencies \n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We establish reserves for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These reserves are established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the outcome of tax audits. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate. \n\nThe reconciliation of our income tax contingencies is as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; December 31, &#160; 2021 2022 2023 Gross tax contingencies &#8211; January 1 $ 2,820 &#160; $ 3,242 &#160; $ 4,002 &#160; Gross increases to tax positions in prior periods 403 &#160; 274 &#160; 440 &#160; Gross decreases to tax positions in prior periods ( 354 ) ( 172 ) ( 38 ) Gross increases to current period tax positions 507 &#160; 706 &#160; 1,009 &#160; Settlements with tax authorities ( 60 ) ( 20 ) ( 106 ) Lapse of statute of limitations ( 74 ) ( 28 ) ( 79 ) Gross tax contingencies &#8211; December 31 (1) $ 3,242 &#160; $ 4,002 &#160; $ 5,228 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n&#160;___________________ \n\n(1) As of December 31, 2023, we had approximately $ 5.2 billion of income tax contingencies of which $ 3.3 billion, if fully recognized, would decrease our effective tax rate. \n\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2023, we had accrued interest and penalties, net of federal income tax benefit, related to tax contingencies of $ 103 million and $ 194 million. Interest and penalties, net of federal income tax benefit, recognized for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022, and 2023 were $ 28 million, $( 7 ) million, and $ 91 million. \n\nWe are under examination, or may be subject to examination, by the Internal Revenue Service for the calendar year 2016 and thereafter. These examinations may lead to ordinary course adjustments or proposed adjustments to our taxes or our net operating losses with respect to years under examination as well as subsequent periods. \n\nWe are also subject to taxation in various states and other foreign jurisdictions including China, France, Germany, India, Japan, Luxembourg, and the United Kingdom. We are under, or may be subject to, audit or examination and additional assessments by the relevant authorities in respect of these particular jurisdictions primarily for 2011 and thereafter. We are currently disputing tax assessments in multiple jurisdictions, including with respect to the allocation and characterization of income. \n\nIn September 2022, the Luxembourg tax authority (&#8220;LTA&#8221;) denied the tax basis of certain intangible assets that we distributed from Luxembourg to the U.S. in 2021. When we are assessed by the LTA, we will need to remit taxes related to this matter. We believe the LTA&#8217;s position is without merit, we intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter, and we expect to recoup taxes paid. \n\nThe Indian tax authority (&#8220;ITA&#8221;) has asserted that tax applies to cloud services fees paid to Amazon in the U.S. We will need to remit taxes related to this matter until it is resolved, which payments could be significant in the aggregate. We believe the ITA&#8217;s position is without merit, we are defending our position vigorously in the Indian courts, and we expect to recoup taxes paid. If this matter is adversely resolved, we could recognize significant additional tax expense, including for taxes previously paid. \n\nIn October 2014, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid. On October 4, 2017, the European Commission announced its decision that determinations by the tax authorities in Luxembourg did not comply with European Union rules on state aid. Based on that decision, the European Commission announced an estimated recovery amount of approximately &#8364; 250 million, plus interest, for the period May 2006 through June 2014, and ordered Luxembourg tax authorities to calculate the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery. Luxembourg computed an initial recovery amount, consistent with the European Commission&#8217;s decision, which we deposited into escrow in March 2018, subject to adjustment pending conclusion of all appeals. In December 2017, Luxembourg appealed the European Commission&#8217;s decision. In May 2018, we appealed. On May 12, 2021, the European Union General Court annulled the European Commission&#8217;s state aid decision. In July 2021, the European Commission appealed the decision to the European Court of Justice. In December 2023, the European Court of Justice affirmed the European Union General Court&#8217;s decision. \n\nChanges in tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations may impact our tax contingencies. Due to various factors, including the inherent complexities and uncertainties of the judicial, administrative, and regulatory processes in certain jurisdictions, the timing of the resolution of income tax controversies is highly uncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts accrued. It is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months we will receive additional assessments by various tax authorities or possibly reach resolution of income tax controversies in one or more jurisdictions. These assessments or settlements could result in changes to our contingencies related to positions on prior years&#8217; tax filings. The actual amount of any change could vary significantly depending on the ultimate timing and nature of any settlements. We cannot currently provide an estimate of the range of possible outcomes. \n\nNote 10 &#8212; SEGMENT INFORMATION \n\nWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. We allocate to segment results the operating expenses &#8220;Fulfillment,&#8221; &#8220;Technology and infrastructure,&#8221; &#8220;Sales and marketing,&#8221; and &#8220;General and administrative&#8221; based on usage, which is generally reflected in the segment in which the costs are incurred. The majority of technology costs recorded in &#8220;Technology and infrastructure&#8221; are incurred in the U.S. and are included in our North America and AWS segments. The majority of infrastructure costs recorded in &#8220;Technology and infrastructure&#8221; are allocated to the AWS segment based on usage. There are no internal revenue transactions between our reportable segments. Our chief operating decision maker (&#8220;CODM&#8221;) regularly reviews consolidated net sales, consolidated operating expenses, and consolidated operating income (loss) by segment. Amounts included in consolidated operating expenses include &#8220;Cost of sales,&#8221; &#8220;Fulfillment,&#8221; &#8220;Technology and infrastructure,&#8221; &#8220;Sales and marketing,&#8221; &#8220;General and administrative,&#8221; and &#8220;Other operating expense (income), net.&#8221; Our CODM manages our business by reviewing annual forecasts and consolidated results by segment on a quarterly basis. \n\nNorth America \n\nThe North America segment primarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from sellers) and advertising and subscription services through North America-focused online and physical stores. This segment includes export sales from these online stores. \n\nInternational \n\nThe International segment primarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from sellers) and advertising and subscription services through internationally-focused online stores. This segment includes export sales from these internationally-focused online stores (including export sales from these online stores to customers in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada), but excludes export sales from our North America-focused online stores. \n\nAWS \n\nThe AWS segment consists of amounts earned from global sales of compute, storage, database, and other services for start-ups, enterprises, government agencies, and academic institutions. \n\nInformation on reportable segments and reconciliation to consolidated net income (loss) is as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\nYear Ended December 31, &#160; 2021 2022 2023 North America Net sales $ 279,833 &#160; $ 315,880 &#160; $ 352,828 &#160; Operating expenses 272,562 &#160; 318,727 &#160; 337,951 &#160; Operating income (loss) $ 7,271 &#160; $ ( 2,847 ) $ 14,877 &#160; International Net sales $ 127,787 &#160; $ 118,007 &#160; $ 131,200 &#160; Operating expenses 128,711 &#160; 125,753 &#160; 133,856 &#160; Operating loss $ ( 924 ) $ ( 7,746 ) $ ( 2,656 ) AWS Net sales $ 62,202 &#160; $ 80,096 &#160; $ 90,757 &#160; Operating expenses 43,670 &#160; 57,255 &#160; 66,126 &#160; Operating income $ 18,532 &#160; $ 22,841 &#160; $ 24,631 &#160; Consolidated Net sales $ 469,822 &#160; $ 513,983 &#160; $ 574,785 &#160; Operating expenses 444,943 &#160; 501,735 &#160; 537,933 &#160; Operating income 24,879 &#160; 12,248 &#160; 36,852 &#160; Total non-operating income (expense) 13,272 &#160; ( 18,184 ) 705 &#160; Benefit (provision) for income taxes ( 4,791 ) 3,217 &#160; ( 7,120 ) Equity-method investment activity, net of tax 4 &#160; ( 3 ) ( 12 ) Net income (loss) $ 33,364 &#160; $ ( 2,722 ) $ 30,425 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nNet sales by groups of similar products and services, which also have similar economic characteristics, is as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n&#160; &#160; \n\nYear Ended December 31, &#160; 2021 2022 2023 Net Sales: Online stores (1) $ 222,075 &#160; $ 220,004 &#160; $ 231,872 &#160; Physical stores (2) 17,075 &#160; 18,963 &#160; 20,030 &#160; Third-party seller services (3) 103,366 &#160; 117,716 &#160; 140,053 &#160; Advertising services (4) 31,160 &#160; 37,739 &#160; 46,906 &#160; Subscription services (5) 31,768 &#160; 35,218 &#160; 40,209 &#160; AWS 62,202 &#160; 80,096 &#160; 90,757 &#160; Other (6) 2,176 &#160; 4,247 &#160; 4,958 &#160; Consolidated $ 469,822 &#160; $ 513,983 &#160; $ 574,785 &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\n___________________ \n\n(1) Includes product sales and digital media content where we record revenue gross.

As a result of this assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2023, our internal control over financial reporting was effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Ernst &#38; Young has independently assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and its report is included below. \n\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2023 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. \n\nLimitations on Controls \n\nOur disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives as specified above. Management does not expect, however, that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. \n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \n\nThe Board of Directors and Shareholders \n\nAmazon.com, Inc. \n\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nWe have audited Amazon.com, Inc.&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Amazon.com, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the COSO criteria. \n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders&#8217; equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023 and the related notes and our report dated February 1, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. \n\nBasis for Opinion \n\nThe Company&#8217;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management&#8217;s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \n\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. \n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \n\nA company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#8217;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\n/s/ Ernst &#38; Young LLP \n\nSeattle, Washington \n\nFebruary 1, 2024 \n\n##TABLE_START ",
