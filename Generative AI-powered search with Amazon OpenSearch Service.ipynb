    "Form 10-K is a comprehensive report filed annually by a publicly traded company about its financial performance and is required by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Some of the information a company is required to document in the 10-K includes its history, organizational structure, financial statements, earnings per share, subsidiaries, executive compensation, and any other relevant data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SEC mandates that all public companies file regular 10-Ks to keep investors aware of a company's financial condition and to allow them to have enough information before they buy or sell securities issued by that company. The 10-K can appear overly complex at first glance, complete with tables full of data and figures. However, it is so comprehensive that this filing is critical for investors to handle a company's financial position and prospects.\n",

    "\n",
    "Here's a bit more detail on how vector search works:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Documents are converted into numerical vector representations using machine learning models like word embeddings or document embeddings. These models learn to map words, phrases, or entire documents into a high-dimensional vector space.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Queries are also converted into vector form, allowing them to be compared to the document vectors in this mathematical vector space.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Rather than doing a simple keyword match, the search engine calculates the similarity between the query vector and each document vector, often using a metric like cosine similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The most similar document vectors are then returned as the search results, even if they don't contain the exact words from the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows vector search to uncover semantically relevant content that would be missed by traditional text-based searches. It's especially useful for tasks like question answering, e-commerce search, and retrieval of similar documents or images.\n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying machine learning models need to be trained on large datasets, but vector search can significantly improve the quality and relevance of search results compared to purely lexical approaches.\n",

In the context of natural language processing (NLP), embeddings are used to represent words, phrases, or sentences as vectors of real numbers. These vectors capture semantic relationships, meaning that words with similar meanings are represented by vectors that are close together in the embedding space.\n",

    "**Embedding models** are machine learning models that are trained to create these numerical representations. They learn to encode various types of data into embeddings that capture the essential characteristics and relationships within the data. For example, in NLP, embedding models like Word2Vec, GloVe, and BERT are trained on large text corpora to produce word embeddings. These embeddings can then be used for various downstream tasks, such as text classification, sentiment analysis, or machine translation. In this case we'll be using it for semantic similarity\n",

      "{'company_name': 'SALESFORCE.COM, INC.', 'item_content': \"Promoting strong customer adoption and reducing customer attrition. We believe that we have the people, processes and proven innovation to help companies transform successfully. We have free, curated resources such as Trailhead to help companies of every size learn our systems, a community of Trailblazers who drive innovation, as well as customer success programs including success management resources, advisory services, technical architects and business strategists to enable and accelerate digital transformation. With these resources and our customer success programs, we aim to reduce attrition and secure renewals of existing customer subscriptions prior to the end of their contractual terms.\\nMergers and Acquisitions and Strategic Investments\\nWe evaluate opportunities to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services, technologies and intellectual property rights to complement our organic innovation and advance the development of our Customer 360 Platform. These evaluations resulted in our acquisition of several companies in recent years, notably our acquisition of Vlocity in fiscal 2021, which expanded our industry-specific cloud and mobile software solutions, and our pending acquisition of Slack.\\nIn addition to mergers and acquisitions, we invest in early-stage companies to more mature companies both domestically and internationally to support our business initiatives and enhance our partner ecosystem. As the enterprise cloud computing ecosystem continues to mature and technologies change, our investment strategy and corresponding investment opportunities have expanded to include investments in companies concurrently with their initial public offerings, as well as larger capital investments in late stage companies and investments in emerging markets. We plan to continue making these types of strategic investments, including in companies representing targeted geographies and targeted business and technological initiatives, as opportunities arise that we find attractive.\\nTechnology, Development and Operations\\nWe primarily deliver our Salesforce solutions as highly scalable cloud computing application and platform services on a multi-tenant technology architecture. Multi-tenancy is an architectural approach that allows us to operate a single application\\ninstance for multiple organizations, treating all customers as separate tenants who run in virtual isolation from each other. This approach allows us to spread the cost of delivering our services across our user base and scale our business faster than traditional software vendors while focusing our resources on building new functionality and enhancing existing offerings.\\nWe have historically provided and continue to provide our services to our customers from infrastructure designed and operated by us but secured within third-party data center facilities. In combination with these third-party data center facilities, we also provide our services via cloud computing platform partners who offer Infrastructure-as-a-Service, including servers, storage, databases and networking. In December 2020, we announced Hyperforce, a reimagination of our platform architecture built to securely and reliably deliver the Customer 360 platform on major public clouds.\\nOur technology and product efforts are focused on improving and enhancing the features, functionality, performance, availability and security of our existing service offerings, as well as developing new features, functionality and services, as well as integrating businesses, services and technologies from acquisitions. Performance, functional depth, security, usability, ease of integration and configuration and sustainability of our solutions influence our technology decisions and product direction.\\nCompetition\\nThe market for our service offerings is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and fragmented, and subject to changing technology with low barriers to entry, shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services.\\nOur current competitors include:\\n•internally developed enterprise applications (by our potential customers’ IT departments);\\n•vendors of packaged business software, as well as companies offering enterprise apps delivered through on-premises offerings from enterprise software application vendors and cloud computing application service providers, either individually or with others;\\n•software companies that provide their product or service free of charge as a single product or when bundled with other offerings, or only charge a premium for advanced features and functionality;\\n•vendors who offer software tailored to specific services that are more directed toward those specific services than our full suite of service offerings;\\n•suppliers of traditional business intelligence and data preparation products, as well as business analytics software companies;\\n•integration software vendors and other companies offering integration or API solutions;\\n•marketing vendors, which may specialize in advertising, targeting, messaging or campaign automation;\\n•e-commerce solutions from established and emerging cloud-only vendors and established on-premises vendors; and\\n•traditional platform development environment companies and cloud computing development platform companies who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new apps that run on the customers’ current infrastructure or as hosted services.\\nWe believe more traditional enterprise software application and platform vendors may become a greater competitive threat as they continue to shift more of their focus to cloud computing service offerings and customer experience management solutions.\\nCustomers\\nWe sell to businesses of all sizes and in almost every industry worldwide. The number of paying subscriptions at each of our customers ranges from one to hundreds of thousands. None of our customers accounted for more than five percent of our revenues in fiscal 2021, 2020 or 2019. In addition, we do not have any material dependencies on any specific product, service or particular group or groups.\\nCustomer Service and Support\\nWe offer professional services to help customers achieve business results faster with Salesforce solutions. Our architects and innovation program teams act as advisors to plan and execute digital transformations for our customers. This includes implementation services for multi-cloud and complex deployments. We provide best-practices and AI-based recommendations and adoption programs globally. In addition, we provide advanced education, including in-person and online courses to certify our customers and partners on architecting, administering, deploying and developing our service offerings.\\nOur global customer support group responds to both business and technical inquiries about the use of our products via the web, telephone, email, social networks and other channels. We provide standard customer support during regular business hours at no charge to customers who purchase any of our paying subscription editions. We also offer premier customer support that is either included in a premium success offering or sold for an additional fee, which can include services such as priority access to technical resources, developer support and system administration. In addition, we offer a premier priority support add-on that is designed to provide customers technical account management with responses for incidents from a dedicated team\\nknowledgeable about the customer's specific enterprise architecture, which offers proactive monitoring and instruction to optimize their usage of our products.\\nSales and Marketing\", 'item_vector': [0.01497914269566536,

    "You can leverage the Large Language Models to generate answers rather than provinding the document back to the user. By provinding these retrieved documents as context to generate answers, we minimizes the halucination. This method is called Retrieval Augmented Generation or simply RAG. In RAG, external data can be sourced from various data sources, such as document repositories, databases, or APIs. The first step is to convert the documents and the user query into a format that enables comparison and allows for performing relevancy search. To achieve comparability for relevancy search, a document collection (knowledge library) and the user-submitted query are transformed into numerical representations using embedding language models. These embeddings are essentially numerical representations of concepts in text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, based on the embedding of the user query, relevant text is identified in the document collection through similarity search in the embedding space. The prompt provided by the user is then combined with the searched relevant text and added to the context. This updated prompt, which includes relevant external data along with the original prompt, is sent to the LLM (Language Model) for processing. As a result, the model output becomes relevant and accurate due to the context containing the relevant external data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The major components of RAG, including embedding, vector databases, augmentation, and generation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Embedding**: Purpose: Embeddings transform text data into numerical vectors in a high-dimensional space. These vectors represent the semantic meaning of the text. Process: The embedding process typically uses pre-trained models (like BERT or a variant) to convert both the input queries and the documents in the database into dense vectors. Role in RAG: Embeddings are crucial for the retrieval component as they allow the model to compute the similarity between the query and the documents in the database efficiently.\n",
    "- **Vector Database**: Function: A vector database stores the embeddings of a large collection of documents or passages. Construction: It is created by processing a vast corpus (like Wikipedia or other specialized datasets) through an embedding model. Usage in RAG: When a query comes in, the model searches this database to find the documents whose embeddings are most similar to the embedding of the query.\n",
    "- **Retrieval (Augmentation)**: Mechanism: The retrieval part of RAG functions by taking the input query, converting it into a vector using embeddings, and then searching the vector database to retrieve relevant documents. Result: It augments the original query with additional context by selecting documents or passages that are semantically related to the query. This augmented information is essential for generating more informed responses.\n",
    "- **Generation**: Integration with a Language Model: The generative component, often a large language model like Amazon Titan Text, receives both the original query and the retrieved documents. Response Generation: It synthesizes information from these inputs to produce a coherent and contextually appropriate response. \n",
    "- **Training and Fine-Tuning**: This component is generally pre-trained on vast amounts of text and may be further fine-tuned to optimize its performance for specific tasks or datasets.\n",
    "- **End-to-End Training (Optional)**: Joint Optimization: In RAG, both retrieval and generation components can be fine-tuned together, allowing the system to optimize the selection of documents and the generation of responses simultaneously. Feedback Loop: The model learns not only to generate relevant responses but also to retrieve the most useful documents for any given query.\n",

Retention and content consumption rates are significantly higher for those that build and continuously strengthen relationships with their end-users. Our deep insights powered by machine learning and our sophisticated customer relationship management tools empower our customers to create, optimize and deliver personalized experiences for their end-users, increasing customer retention and engagement rates and resulting in higher end-user lifetime value (LTV).\\n•deltaDNA: a portfolio of services our customers use to understand behaviors of end-users within their game and to take action to improve user experiences. These services include:\\n•In-depth, high fidelity analytics tools used to understand end-user behavior and drive insights.\\n•Predictive tools that automatically promote actions that will improve LTV through personalization of content and monetization strategies. One such example is the determination of whether to show an in-app purchase promotion versus advertising content depending on an individual end-user’s preferences.\\n•Machine-learning driven capabilities that predict the likelihood of player churn or an in-app purchase. With this information, our customers can further personalize content and run campaigns to retain these players at scale.\\n•A Dynamic Ad Placement tool that optimizes ad placement across as many unique surface points as the developer chooses to integrate. Our machine-learning driven algorithms connect customer data with rich content selection and our ad monetization models to maximize both retention and revenue for higher end-user LTV.\\n•GameTune: a machine learning solution that provides data science as a service. This gives customers the ability to optimize end-user engagement based on a combination of game elements, such as game progression speed, in-app purchase bundles and difficulty settings.\\nCloud Operations\\nDevelopers face technical challenges and unpredictable costs as they launch and run multiplayer, multi-platform games and applications across mobile, PC and console platforms and game genres. Delays and downtimes are detrimental to our customers, who therefore place a high value on reliable solutions with predictable cost structures. Our Multiplay, Vivox, Cloud Content Delivery, Build Server, and Simulation products focus on delivering real-time content and on optimizing the end-user experience.\\n•Multiplay: a dynamic orchestration service that optimizes performance and cost by choosing the best hosting solution in real-time, leveraging the leading third-party cloud service providers as well as co-located data centers. This bypasses the complexity of creating and operating back-end technology and infrastructure, reducing the time and resources required to launch and operate real-time multiplayer games at scale.\\n•Vivox: a hosted voice and text service that enables end-users to communicate with each other within real-time games and applications, and across multiple platforms, including iOS, Android, Windows, Mac, and consoles. It features 3D positional audio that enables life-like communications within a 3D world. We also offer optional enterprise-level support that includes dedicated servers, integration support teams, virtually unlimited scale and 24/7 operations support. Vivox enables the social aspect of games and drives greater player immersion and higher engagement.\\n•Cloud Content Delivery: a service optimizing the delivery of content to end-user devices, enabling applications to be smaller and therefore accessible across a larger range of devices, increasing distribution opportunities for our creators.\\nUnity Software Inc.\\n•Build Server: a solution to offload Unity project builds to network hardware, providing centralized, stable and reliable environments for building distributed development projects, while driving higher project quality and avoiding costly downtime.\\n•Furioos: cloud-based streaming technology that makes it easy to share complex, interactive 3D applications on web browsers and embed them onto websites.\\n•Simulation: a suite of products that harnesses the power of cloud computing to run millions of simulations to test, train, and validate projects at scale.\\n•GameSim: a cloud-based gameplay simulation service for game creators. GameSim is used during production or pre-launch of a game in order to test and ensure the quality and performance of the game and to test live game operations as well as optimize and balance game challenges versus rewards.\\n•Unity Simulation: a cloud-based simulation tool for creators in other industries. Unity Simulation can be used at any point in the development process to test multiple complex scenarios and validate concepts without any up-front hardware investment. While the product is primarily focused on automotive and robotics industries, the product can be used for any project, prototype, or concept created in Unity.\\nOur Customers\\nOur globally diverse customers range from the largest global enterprises, to mid-market companies, to government and non-profit institutions, to mid-sized, small and independent businesses and individuals. As of December 31, 2020, we had 793 customers with over $100,000 in trailing 12-month revenue, who together represented the substantial majority of our revenue.\\nWe define a customer as an individual or entity that generated revenue during the measurement period. A single organization with multiple divisions, segments or subsidiaries is generally counted as a single customer, even though we may enter into commercial agreements with multiple parties within that organization. For example, one of our large enterprise customers is Zynga. We consider all Unity subscriptions and services purchased by Zynga-owned studios to be purchased by Zynga as a single customer.\\nFor each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, 36%, 34%, and 32% of our revenue was generated by customers in EMEA, respectively. For each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, 34%, 33%, and 33% of our revenue was generated by customers in Asia-Pacific, respectively. For each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, 30%, 33%, and 35% of our revenue was generated by customers in the Americas, respectively. No one customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.\\nSales and Marketing\\nOur go-to-market approach is driven by the strength of our brand, organic creator demand, targeted account-based marketing and a solutions-oriented sales process. We execute a multi-channel model that enables a targeted and cost-effective approach. We combine a web-based system for smaller customers with direct sales efforts for acquiring and expanding product and service penetration within small and medium-sized businesses and enterprise customers. This strategy is supported by a highly effective customer and community support ecosystem and by education programs.\\nDirect Sales\\nWe use our global direct sales force to acquire new medium to enterprise-sized customers and increase adoption of products and services within these customers. Our enterprise sales, customer success and field engineering teams have deep domain expertise in the industries they serve.\\nUnity Software Inc.\\nWe also deploy technical professionals in our Worldwide Professional Services group who help our customers to complete the development of content made with Unity and facilitate the process of deploying real-time 3D in both gaming and other industries.\\nFor mid-sized, small and independent companies, we leverage a lower-cost inside sales team and an indirect value-added reseller network to cost-effectively reach these customers.\\n\\nUnity Software Inc.\\nUNITY SOFTWARE INC.\\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\nDescription of Business\\nWe were founded as Over the Edge Entertainment in Denmark in 2004. We reorganized as a Delaware corporation on May 28, 2009 as Unity Software Inc. (collectively referred to with its wholly owned subsidiaries as “we,” “our” or “us,”). We provide a comprehensive set of software solutions to create, run and monetize interactive, real-time 2D and 3D content for mobile phones, tablets, PCs, consoles, and augmented and virtual reality devices, among others.\\nWe are headquartered in San Francisco, California and have operations in the United States, Denmark, Belgium, Canada, China, Colombia, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Japan, Lithuania, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.\\nWe market our solutions directly through our online store and field sales operations in North America, Denmark, Finland, the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, China, Singapore, and South Korea and indirectly through independent distributors and resellers worldwide.\\nBasis of Presentation and Consolidation\\nWe prepared the accompanying consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Unity Software Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. We have eliminated all intercompany balances and transactions. In our opinion, the information contained herein reflects all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of our results of operations, financial position, cash flows, and stockholders’ equity. All such adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature.\\nEffective January 1, 2020, we adopted the requirements of updates to accounting pronouncements as described below under the heading “Leases” and in Note 2, “Summary of Accounting Pronouncements,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\\nInitial Public Offering (“IPO”)\\nOn September 22, 2020, we completed our IPO, in which we issued and sold 25,000,000 shares of our common stock at the public offering price of $52.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds of $1,241.3 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions. On September 24, 2020, the underwriters exercised their option to purchase an additional 3,750,000 shares of our common stock at the public offering price of $52.00 per share, resulting in total issued shares of 28,750,000. This option exercise closed on September 28, 2020, resulting in additional net proceeds to us of $186.2 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions. In connection with the IPO, all of the shares of our outstanding convertible preferred stock automatically converted into an aggregate of 102,717,396 shares of our common stock.\\nDeferred offering costs consist primarily of accounting, legal, and other fees related to our IPO. Upon completion of the IPO, $9.9 million of deferred offering costs incurred were presented in stockholders’ equity as a reduction of the IPO proceeds.\\nUnity Software Inc.\\nUse of Estimates\\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. For us, these estimates include, but are not limited to, revenue recognition, allowances for doubtful accounts, fair values of financial instruments, useful lives of fixed assets, the incremental borrowing rate (“IBR”) we use to determine our operating lease liabilities, income taxes, valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, valuation of intangible assets, useful lives of intangible assets, assets acquired and liabilities assumed through business combinations, fair value of our common stock prior to our IPO, valuation of stock-based compensation, capitalization of software costs and software implementation costs, customer life for capitalized commissions, and other contingencies, among others. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and such differences could be material to our financial position and results of operations.\\nRevenue Recognition\\nRevenue is recognized upon the transfer of control of promised products and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services.\\nWe evaluate and recognize revenue by:\\n•identifying the contract(s) with the customer;\\n•identifying the performance obligation(s) in the contract(s);\\n•determining the transaction price;\\n•allocating the transaction price to performance obligation(s) in the contract(s); and\\n•recognizing revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied through the transfer of a promised good or service to a customer (“transfer of control”).\\nThe five-step model requires us to make significant estimates in situations where we are unable to establish stand-alone selling price based on various observable prices using all information that is reasonably available. Observable inputs and information we use to make these estimates include historical internal pricing data and cost plus margin analysis.\\nWe generate revenue through three sources: (1) Create Solutions, which consists primarily of our subscription offerings and professional services; (2) Operate Solutions, which includes our monetization services, hosting, and multiplayer services, and voice services; and (3) Strategic Partnerships and Other, which are primarily arrangements with strategic hardware, operating system, device, game console, and other technology providers for the customization and development of our software to enable interoperability with these platforms. We recognize revenue as our contractual performance obligations are satisfied. When contracts with our customers contain multiple performance obligations, we allocate the overall transaction price, which is the amount of consideration to which we expect to receive in exchange for promised goods or services, to each of the distinct performance obligations based on their estimated relative standalone selling prices.\\nUnity Software Inc.\\nCreate Solutions\\nCreate Solutions Subscriptions\\n\\nOur Create Solutions allow creators to easily develop, edit and iterate interactive 2D and 3D content, in real-time. We offer our customers tiered subscription plans designed to meet the needs of different types of customers:\\n•Unity Pro: designed for customers with over $200,000 in annual revenue or funding, provides access to our engine with additional benefits, such as prioritized customer support, collaboration tools, and the option to purchase professional services, additional support, and licenses to our source code.\\n•Unity Enterprise: designed for larger teams, provides custom solutions at scale with flexibility to adapt to the needs of businesses. Unity Enterprise is designed for our larger customers in gaming and other industries and provides a suite of solutions that includes Unity Pro, PiXYZ data optimization plug-in, HMI toolkit, and an immersive design collaboration toolkit.\\nUnity Software Inc.\\n•Unity Plus: provides mid-sized, small and independent customers access to our platform with analytics and diagnostics tools and other services. Additional training resources are included to accelerate adoption and to give creators of all experience levels advanced and up-to-date support.\\n•Unity Personal: Our free solution caters to creators with less than $100,000 in revenue or funding in the last 12 months and is ideal for new real-time 3D developers. Unity Personal serves as a valuable on-ramp to our other price tiers and products.\\n•Unity Student: our free offering for verified students that provides access to our engine and additional learning tools.\\nOur Create Solutions also include our Assisted Artistry tools, including ArtEngine and Granite, which use machine-learning algorithms to accelerate material creation and editing.\\n•ArtEngine: our powerful 3D content creation tool that uses AI to help create ultra-realistic digital artwork. ArtEngine removes the burden of minutiae involved in material creation work-such as photoconversion to physically based rendered materials, resolution enhancement, deblur, seam removal, unwarping, and color matching-helping artists focus on value-added parts of the creative workflow.\\n•Granite: provides an advanced texture system for content. By automatically loading and managing texture tiles, Granite is able to handle large amounts of texture data while using less memory, significantly reducing loading time for larger, detailed virtual worlds.\\nWe have introduced and will continue to develop Create Solutions that are specifically focused on industries beyond gaming, such as Unity Reflect and Unity Forma, and emerging augmented and virtual reality platforms, like Unity MARS.\\n•Unity Reflect: enables creators in architecture, engineering, and construction to seamlessly transfer building information modeling, or BIM, data into Unity to create real-time 3D experiences across multiple platforms, including augmented and virtual reality. Released in late 2019, Reflect allows multiple designers and building engineers working on different systems to bring their data sets into one Reflect project, while maintaining a live connection to original design models. This functionality enables augmented and virtual reality and iOS, PC, and Mac viewers to review live-linked models in real-time. Reflect is accessible to any designer, including those not familiar with developing on our platform.\\n•Unity MARS: gives creators professional-grade workflows for augmented and virtual reality development. Unity MARS brings environment and sensor data into the creative process, enabling creators to build applications that are context-aware and responsive to physical space. Creators are able to build, prototype and visualize data-oriented applications in real-time without leaving the Unity editor.\\n•Unity Forma: offers creators a product configuration toolkit with the high fidelity of Unity’s real-time 3D interactivity and rendering power. Creators are empowered to fast-track the creation of visually appealing digital marketing experiences for use cases across industries such as automotive, retail, and others. These experiences, or configurators, can be distributed to a wide audience through the significant and varied platform compatibility of the Unity runtime.\\nOperate Solutions\\nOur Operate Solutions offer customers the ability to grow and engage their end-users, and to run and monetize their content, optimizing end-user acquisition and operational costs while increasing the lifetime value of their end-users.\\nUnity Software Inc.\\nUser Acquisition and Monetization\\nMany of our customers create games and applications with the purpose of building a profitable business. This requires both the acquisition of end-users at a reasonable cost and the monetization of these end-users as they engage over time with the content.\\nOur user acquisition products enable advertisers to efficiently acquire new end-users at scale. They operate within our monetization ecosystem, which reached over 2.6 billion monthly active end users as of December 31, 2020, making it one of the largest global user bases for advertisers. Our focus and strength are in pay-for-performance end-user acquisition, where advertisers pay us based on a tangible outcome or set goal, such as an install, rather than on a cost per impression basis. As a result, a large number of our advertisers have open spending limits with us as they can clearly measure the positive return on their spend.\\n•Personalized Advertising: an end-user acquisition product that uses machine learning combined with our deep player and game data to drive end-user installs at scale. Advertisers can define campaigns based on several parameters:\\n•Reach: advertisers define the amount they are willing to pay for each install. Our algorithm maximizes reach and identifies the audience with the highest propensity to install.\\n•Retention: our algorithms dynamically adjust the cost per install based on the likelihood of customer retention over 7-day, 14-day and other retention periods. This minimizes the risk that our customer will spend to acquire end-users that are unlikely to yield attractive returns, including those that churn almost immediately.\\n•Desired Return on Ad Spend (ROAS): our algorithms dynamically adjust the cost per install based on a combination of the ROAS target set by the advertiser and the predicted lifetime value of an end-user.\\n•Contextual Advertising: a product designed for cases in which our customers or their end-users opt-out of personalization within apps. With the depth and breadth of our in-game data, we can deliver highly relevant advertising while respecting stricter privacy elections.\\nOur monetization products generate revenue for our customers in two primary ways. First, we provide in-app advertising technology that connects our customers to a broad range of advertisers is powered by our Unified Auction. Second, we provide micro-transaction capabilities that enable revenue through in-app purchases, or IAP.\\n•Unity Ads: enables developers to seek the highest value for each impression of their inventory, through our Unified Auction, from a broad range of advertisers including direct Unity customers as well as demand side platforms, or DSPs. Each time an event is triggered within our customer’s application, our auction determines the best advertisement to show the end user. Customers can access Unity Ads through a software development kit that enables ad delivery, rendering, and transactions.\\n•Unity IAP: allows for the sale of virtual goods within free or paid games on all major platforms by enabling creators to create once and connect to all major platform stores (for example the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store), utilizing a convenient single integration.\\nUnity Software Inc.\\nEnd-User Engagement\\n\\nNet cash used in investing activities (575,190) (219,541) (40,043)\\nNet cash provided by financing activities 1,701,455 161,472 148,251\\nEffect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash 673 (172) (8)\\nNet change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ 1,146,851 $ (126,177) $ 27,141\\nCash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities\\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, cash provided by operating activities was $19.9 million, which consisted of a net loss of $282.3 million, adjusted by non-cash charges of $244.5 million and net cash inflows from the change in net operating assets and liabilities of $57.8 million. The non-cash charges primarily consisted of depreciation and amortization of $43.0 million, stock-based compensation of $134.6 million, and a common stock charitable donation expense of $63.6 million. The net cash inflows from the change in our net operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a $41.6 million increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, a $44.6 million increase in publisher payables, and a $37.4 million increase in deferred revenue. This was partially offset by a $63.3 million increase in accounts receivable and a $13.0 million increase in other current assets. A substantial portion of our accounts receivable balance comes from advertising partners and is offset by an accounts payable amount due to our publishers (Operate Solutions customers). However, the payment terms that we offer our advertising partners are generally shorter than the payment terms with our publishers (Operate Solutions customers). As such, our cash flows fluctuate from period to period due to revenue seasonality, timing of billings, collections, and publisher payments. Historical cash flows are not necessarily indicative of our results in any future period.\\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in operating activities was $67.9 million, which consisted of a net loss of $163.2 million, adjusted by non-cash charges of $75.7 million and net cash inflows from the change in net operating assets and liabilities of $19.5 million. The non-cash charges primarily consisted of stock-based compensation of $44.5 million and depreciation and amortization of $31.1 million. The net cash inflows from the change in our net operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a $31.1 million increase in deferred revenue, an increase in publisher payables of $20.2 million, and a $13.2 million increase in income and other taxes payable. This was partially offset by a $49.4 million increase in accounts receivable, all due to an increase in sales, including in the fourth quarter, which has historically been our strongest quarter for new business within our Create Solutions business and for usage levels within our Operate Solutions business.\\nCash Used in Investing Activities\\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, cash used in investing activities was $575.2 million, consisting of the purchase of marketable securities of $482.5 million, cash used in acquisitions of $53.2 million, and capital expenditures of $40.2 million.\\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in investing activities was $219.5 million, consisting of cash used in acquisitions of $192.5 million and capital expenditures of $27.0 million.\\nUnity Software Inc.\\nCash Provided by Financing Activities\\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, cash provided by financing activities was $1,701.5 million, primarily consisting of net proceeds of $1,417.6 million from our initial public offering, net proceeds of $250.0 million from the issuance of convertible preferred stock and common stock, proceeds of $125.0 million from the revolving loan facility, and proceeds of $25.4 million from the exercise of stock options. The net cash outflows from financing activities was primarily due to the $125.0 million repayment of principal on our revolving loan facility.\\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, cash provided by financing activities was $161.5 million, consisting of proceeds from the issuance of convertible preferred stock and common stock of $585.1 million and stock option exercises of $11.8 million, partially offset by $435.1 million used for the repurchase of our stock and the purchase of shares of our common stock and vested stock options pursuant to a tender offer, and $0.4 million of debt issuance costs in connection with our $125.0 million Credit Agreement.\\nContractual Obligations\\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 (in thousands):\\nPayments Due by Period\\nTotal Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 Years\\nOperating leases (1)\\n$ 141,762 $ 30,176 $ 49,567 $ 32,735 $ 29,284\\nPurchase commitments (2)\\n153,870 48,502 89,743 15,625 -\\nTotal (3)\\n$ 295,632 $ 78,678 $ 139,310 $ 48,360 $ 29,284\\n(1) Operating lease obligations consist primarily of obligations for real estate.\\n(2) The substantial majority of our purchase commitments are related to agreements with our data center hosting providers.\\n(3) This table generally excludes amounts related to income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions, since we cannot predict with reasonable reliability the timing of cash settlements to the respective taxing authorities.\\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\\nWe have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements and did not have any material holdings in variable interest entities as of December 31, 2020.\\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\\nManagement’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenue generated and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, and any such differences may be material. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management’s judgments and estimates.\\nUnity Software Inc.\\nRevenue Recognition\\nWe generate revenue through three sources: (1) Create Solutions, which is composed primarily of our subscription offerings and professional services; (2) Operate Solutions, which includes our monetization services, hosting, and multiplayer services, and voice services; and (3) Strategic Partnerships and Other, which are primarily arrangements with strategic hardware, operating system, device, game console, and other technology providers for the customization and development of our software to enable interoperability with these platforms.\\nWe evaluate and recognize revenue by:\\n•identifying the contract(s) with the customer;\\n•identifying the performance obligation(s) in the contract(s);\\n•determining the transaction price;\\n•allocating the transaction price to performance obligation(s) in the contract(s); and\\n•recognizing revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied through the transfer of a promised good or service to a customer which we refer to as a transfer of control.\\n\\nUnity Software Inc.\\nCreate Solutions\\nCreate Solutions Subscriptions\\nOur subscriptions, mainly consisting of Unity Pro and Unity Plus (collectively, the “Create Solutions subscriptions”) are fully integrated content development solutions that enable customers to build interactive real-time 2D and 3D applications. These Create Solutions subscriptions provide customers with the rights to a software license with embedded cloud functionality and multi-platform support. Significant judgment is required to determine the level of integration and interdependency between individual promises of the Create Solutions subscriptions. This determination influences whether the software is considered distinct and accounted for separately as a license performance obligation recognized at a point in time, or not distinct and accounted for together with other promises in the Create Solutions subscriptions as a single performance obligation recognized over time. Under Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“Topic 606”), we have concluded that the software license is not distinct from the multi-platform support as they are highly interdependent and interrelated considering the significant two-way dependency between the promises. Although the promise to the embedded cloud functionality represents separate performance obligations under Topic 606, we have accounted for these obligations as if they are a single performance obligation that includes the software license and the multi-platform support because the cloud functionality has the same pattern of transfer to the customer over the duration of the subscription term.\\nThe transaction price is determined based on the consideration that we will be entitled to receive in exchange for transferring our Create Solutions subscriptions to the customer, and we do not have material variable consideration. We recognize the single performance obligation ratably over the contract term beginning when the license key is delivered.\\nEnterprise customers may purchase an enhanced support offering (“Enterprise Support”) that is sold separately from the Create Solutions subscriptions, and is capable of being distinct, and is distinct within the context of the contract due to its separate utility. Enterprise Support is generally billed in advance and is recognized ratably over the support term as we have a stand-ready performance obligation over the support term. When an arrangement includes Enterprise Support and Create Solutions subscriptions, which have the same pattern of transfer to the customer (the services transfer to the customer over the same period), we account for those performance obligations as if they are a single performance obligation. If an arrangement includes Enterprise Support and Create Solutions subscriptions that do not have the same pattern of transfer, we allocate the transaction price to the distinct performance obligations and recognize them ratably over their respective terms.\\nCreate Solutions subscriptions typically have a term of one to three years and are generally billed in advance and recognized ratably over the term.\\nProfessional Services\\nOur professional services revenue is primarily composed of consulting, integration, training, and custom application and workflow development. Professional services may be billed in advance or on a time and materials basis and we recognize the related revenue as services are rendered.\\nWe typically invoice our customers up front or when promised services are delivered, and the payment terms vary by customer type and location. The term between billing and payment due dates is not significant. As a result, we have determined that our contracts do not include significant financing component.\\nCustomer billings related to taxes imposed by and remitted to governmental authorities on revenue-producing transactions are reported on a net basis.\\nUnity Software Inc.\\nOperate Solutions\\nMonetization\\nWe generate advertising revenue through our monetization solutions, including the Unified Auction, which allows publishers to sell the available advertising inventory from their mobile applications to advertisers. We enter into contracts with both advertisers and publishers to participate in the Unified Auction. For advertisements placed through the Unified Auction, we evaluate whether we are the principal (in which case revenue is reported on a gross basis) or the agent (in which case revenue is reported on a net basis). The evaluation to present revenue on a gross basis versus net basis requires significant judgment. We have concluded that the publisher is our customer and we are the agent in facilitating the fulfillment of the advertising inventory in the Unified Auction primarily because we do not control the advertising inventory prior to the placement of an advertisement. As the operator of the Unified Auction, our role is to enable the publisher to monetize its advertising inventory with the advertiser based on the bid/ask price from the auction. We do not control the outcome of the bids and do not have pricing latitude in the transaction. Based on these and other factors, we report advertising revenue based on the net amount retained from the transaction which is our revenue share. Advertising revenue is recognized at a point in time when control is transferred to the customer. This occurs when a user installs an application after seeing an advertisement contracted on a cost-per-install basis or when an advertisement starts on a cost-per-impression basis. Typically, we do not retain a share of the revenue generated through Unity IAP (“In-App Purchases”). Publisher payables represent amounts earned by publishers in the Unified Auction and are presented as a reduction of revenue in our consolidated statements of operations. Payment terms are contractually defined and vary by publisher and location.\\nCloud and Hosting Services\\nWe provide cloud-based services as well as enterprise hosting (“Hosting Services”) to developers that develop and operate multiuser/multiplayer games and applications through a combination of hardware server and cloud-based infrastructure and services. The Hosting Services facilitate the connection of end users, and allow content game and application operators to monitor network traffic. Our cloud-based services provide our customers with tools and services to develop and operate live games and applications, including voice chat services. We primarily sell these services on a fixed fee or usage-based model with fixed fees billed monthly in advance and usage fees billed monthly in arrears. We recognize revenue ratably over the contractual service term for fixed fee arrangements as we have a stand-ready performance obligation that is generally fulfilled evenly throughout the hosting period. We recognize revenue for usage-based arrangements as services are provided.\\nStrategic Partnerships and Other\\nWe enter into strategic contracts with owners of hardware, operating system, device, game console and other technology providers to customize our software licenses to enable interoperability with these platforms (“Strategic Partnerships”). This allows customers using our Create Solutions subscriptions to build and publish content to more than one platform without having to write platform-specific code. We consider these strategic partners as our customers and generally provide them with the following promises in our contracts: (i) development and customization of our software to integrate with the customer’s platform and (ii) post-integration ongoing support and updates.\"\n",

Retention and content consumption rates are significantly higher for those that build and continuously strengthen relationships with their end-users. Our deep insights powered by machine learning and our sophisticated customer relationship management tools empower our customers to create, optimize and deliver personalized experiences for their end-users, increasing customer retention and engagement rates and resulting in higher end-user lifetime value (LTV).\\n•deltaDNA: a portfolio of services our customers use to understand behaviors of end-users within their game and to take action to improve user experiences. These services include:\\n•In-depth, high fidelity analytics tools used to understand end-user behavior and drive insights.\\n•Predictive tools that automatically promote actions that will improve LTV through personalization of content and monetization strategies. One such example is the determination of whether to show an in-app purchase promotion versus advertising content depending on an individual end-user’s preferences.\\n•Machine-learning driven capabilities that predict the likelihood of player churn or an in-app purchase. With this information, our customers can further personalize content and run campaigns to retain these players at scale.\\n•A Dynamic Ad Placement tool that optimizes ad placement across as many unique surface points as the developer chooses to integrate. Our machine-learning driven algorithms connect customer data with rich content selection and our ad monetization models to maximize both retention and revenue for higher end-user LTV.\\n•GameTune: a machine learning solution that provides data science as a service. This gives customers the ability to optimize end-user engagement based on a combination of game elements, such as game progression speed, in-app purchase bundles and difficulty settings.\\nCloud Operations\\nDevelopers face technical challenges and unpredictable costs as they launch and run multiplayer, multi-platform games and applications across mobile, PC and console platforms and game genres. Delays and downtimes are detrimental to our customers, who therefore place a high value on reliable solutions with predictable cost structures. Our Multiplay, Vivox, Cloud Content Delivery, Build Server, and Simulation products focus on delivering real-time content and on optimizing the end-user experience.\\n•Multiplay: a dynamic orchestration service that optimizes performance and cost by choosing the best hosting solution in real-time, leveraging the leading third-party cloud service providers as well as co-located data centers. This bypasses the complexity of creating and operating back-end technology and infrastructure, reducing the time and resources required to launch and operate real-time multiplayer games at scale.\\n•Vivox: a hosted voice and text service that enables end-users to communicate with each other within real-time games and applications, and across multiple platforms, including iOS, Android, Windows, Mac, and consoles.

Vivox enables the social aspect of games and drives greater player immersion and higher engagement.\\n•Cloud Content Delivery: a service optimizing the delivery of content to end-user devices, enabling applications to be smaller and therefore accessible across a larger range of devices, increasing distribution opportunities for our creators.\\nUnity Software Inc.\\n•Build Server: a solution to offload Unity project builds to network hardware, providing centralized, stable and reliable environments for building distributed development projects, while driving higher project quality and avoiding costly downtime.\\n•Furioos: cloud-based streaming technology that makes it easy to share complex, interactive 3D applications on web browsers and embed them onto websites.\\n•Simulation: a suite of products that harnesses the power of cloud computing to run millions of simulations to test, train, and validate projects at scale.\\n•GameSim: a cloud-based gameplay simulation service for game creators. GameSim is used during production or pre-launch of a game in order to test and ensure the quality and performance of the game and to test live game operations as well as optimize and balance game challenges versus rewards.\\n•Unity Simulation: a cloud-based simulation tool for creators in other industries. Unity Simulation can be used at any point in the development process to test multiple complex scenarios and validate concepts without any up-front hardware investment. While the product is primarily focused on automotive and robotics industries, the product can be used for any project, prototype, or concept created in Unity.\\nOur Customers\\nOur globally diverse customers range from the largest global enterprises, to mid-market companies, to government and non-profit institutions, to mid-sized, small and independent businesses and individuals. As of December 31, 2020, we had 793 customers with over $100,000 in trailing 12-month revenue, who together represented the substantial majority of our revenue.\\nWe define a customer as an individual or entity that generated revenue during the measurement period. A single organization with multiple divisions, segments or subsidiaries is generally counted as a single customer, even though we may enter into commercial agreements with multiple parties within that organization. For example, one of our large enterprise customers is Zynga. We consider all Unity subscriptions and services purchased by Zynga-owned studios to be purchased by Zynga as a single customer.\\nFor each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, 36%, 34%, and 32% of our revenue was generated by customers in EMEA, respectively. For each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, 34%, 33%, and 33% of our revenue was generated by customers in Asia-Pacific, respectively. For each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, 30%, 33%, and 35% of our revenue was generated by customers in the Americas, respectively. No one customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.\\nSales and Marketing\\nOur go-to-market approach is driven by the strength of our brand, organic creator demand, targeted account-based marketing and a solutions-oriented sales process. We execute a multi-channel model that enables a targeted and cost-effective approach. We combine a web-based system for smaller customers with direct sales efforts for acquiring and expanding product and service penetration within small and medium-sized businesses and enterprise customers. This strategy is supported by a highly effective customer and community support ecosystem and by education programs.\\nDirect Sales\\nWe use our global direct sales force to acquire new medium to enterprise-sized customers and increase adoption of products and services within these customers. Our enterprise sales, customer success and field engineering teams have deep domain expertise in the industries they serve.\\nUnity Software Inc.\\nWe also deploy technical professionals in our Worldwide Professional Services group who help our customers to complete the development of content made with Unity and facilitate the process of deploying real-time 3D in both gaming and other industries.\\nFor mid-sized, small and independent companies, we leverage a lower-cost inside sales team and an indirect value-added reseller network to cost-effectively reach these customers.\\n\\nUnity Software Inc.\\nUNITY SOFTWARE INC.\\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n1. Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\nDescription of Business\\nWe were founded as Over the Edge Entertainment in Denmark in 2004. We reorganized as a Delaware corporation on May 28, 2009 as Unity Software Inc. (collectively referred to with its wholly owned subsidiaries as “we,” “our” or “us,”). We provide a comprehensive set of software solutions to create, run and monetize interactive, real-time 2D and 3D content for mobile phones, tablets, PCs, consoles, and augmented and virtual reality devices, among others.\\nWe are headquartered in San Francisco, California and have operations in the United States, Denmark, Belgium, Canada, China, Colombia, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Japan, Lithuania, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.\\nWe market our solutions directly through our online store and field sales operations in North America, Denmark, Finland, the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, China, Singapore, and South Korea and indirectly through independent distributors and resellers worldwide.\\nBasis of Presentation and Consolidation\\nWe prepared the accompanying consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Unity Software Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. We have eliminated all intercompany balances and transactions. In our opinion, the information contained herein reflects all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of our results of operations, financial position, cash flows, and stockholders’ equity. All such adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature.\\nEffective January 1, 2020, we adopted the requirements of updates to accounting pronouncements as described below under the heading “Leases” and in Note 2, “Summary of Accounting Pronouncements,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\\nInitial Public Offering (“IPO”)\\nOn September 22, 2020, we completed our IPO, in which we issued and sold 25,000,000 shares of our common stock at the public offering price of $52.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds of $1,241.3 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions. On September 24, 2020, the underwriters exercised their option to purchase an additional 3,750,000 shares of our common stock at the public offering price of $52.00 per share, resulting in total issued shares of 28,750,000. This option exercise closed on September 28, 2020, resulting in additional net proceeds to us of $186.2 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions. In connection with the IPO, all of the shares of our outstanding convertible preferred stock automatically converted into an aggregate of 102,717,396 shares of our common stock.\\nDeferred offering costs consist primarily of accounting, legal, and other fees related to our IPO. Upon completion of the IPO, $9.9 million of deferred offering costs incurred were presented in stockholders’ equity as a reduction of the IPO proceeds.\\nUnity Software Inc.\\nUse of Estimates\\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. For us, these estimates include, but are not limited to, revenue recognition, allowances for doubtful accounts, fair values of financial instruments, useful lives of fixed assets, the incremental borrowing rate (“IBR”) we use to determine our operating lease liabilities, income taxes, valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, valuation of intangible assets, useful lives of intangible assets, assets acquired and liabilities assumed through business combinations, fair value of our common stock prior to our IPO, valuation of stock-based compensation, capitalization of software costs and software implementation costs, customer life for capitalized commissions, and other contingencies, among others. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and such differences could be material to our financial position and results of operations.\\nRevenue Recognition\\nRevenue is recognized upon the transfer of control of promised products and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services.\\nWe evaluate and recognize revenue by:\\n•identifying the contract(s) with the customer;\\n•identifying the performance obligation(s) in the contract(s);\\n•determining the transaction price;\\n•allocating the transaction price to performance obligation(s) in the contract(s); and\\n•recognizing revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied through the transfer of a promised good or service to a customer (“transfer of control”).\\nThe five-step model requires us to make significant estimates in situations where we are unable to establish stand-alone selling price based on various observable prices using all information that is reasonably available. Observable inputs and information we use to make these estimates include historical internal pricing data and cost plus margin analysis.\\nWe generate revenue through three sources: (1) Create Solutions, which consists primarily of our subscription offerings and professional services; (2) Operate Solutions, which includes our monetization services, hosting, and multiplayer services, and voice services; and (3) Strategic Partnerships and Other, which are primarily arrangements with strategic hardware, operating system, device, game console, and other technology providers for the customization and development of our software to enable interoperability with these platforms. We recognize revenue as our contractual performance obligations are satisfied. When contracts with our customers contain multiple performance obligations, we allocate the overall transaction price, which is the amount of consideration to which we expect to receive in exchange for promised goods or services, to each of the distinct performance obligations based on their estimated relative standalone selling prices.\\nUnity Software Inc.\\nCreate Solutions\\nCreate Solutions Subscriptions\\n\\nOur Create Solutions allow creators to easily develop, edit and iterate interactive 2D and 3D content, in real-time. We offer our customers tiered subscription plans designed to meet the needs of different types of customers:\\n•Unity Pro: designed for customers with over $200,000 in annual revenue or funding, provides access to our engine with additional benefits, such as prioritized customer support, collaboration tools, and the option to purchase professional services, additional support, and licenses to our source code.\\n•Unity Enterprise: designed for larger teams, provides custom solutions at scale with flexibility to adapt to the needs of businesses.

By automatically loading and managing texture tiles, Granite is able to handle large amounts of texture data while using less memory, significantly reducing loading time for larger, detailed virtual worlds.\\nWe have introduced and will continue to develop Create Solutions that are specifically focused on industries beyond gaming, such as Unity Reflect and Unity Forma, and emerging augmented and virtual reality platforms, like Unity MARS.\\n•Unity Reflect: enables creators in architecture, engineering, and construction to seamlessly transfer building information modeling, or BIM, data into Unity to create real-time 3D experiences across multiple platforms, including augmented and virtual reality. Released in late 2019, Reflect allows multiple designers and building engineers working on different systems to bring their data sets into one Reflect project, while maintaining a live connection to original design models. This functionality enables augmented and virtual reality and iOS, PC, and Mac viewers to review live-linked models in real-time. Reflect is accessible to any designer, including those not familiar with developing on our platform.\\n•Unity MARS: gives creators professional-grade workflows for augmented and virtual reality development. Unity MARS brings environment and sensor data into the creative process, enabling creators to build applications that are context-aware and responsive to physical space. Creators are able to build, prototype and visualize data-oriented applications in real-time without leaving the Unity editor.\\n•Unity Forma: offers creators a product configuration toolkit with the high fidelity of Unity’s real-time 3D interactivity and rendering power. Creators are empowered to fast-track the creation of visually appealing digital marketing experiences for use cases across industries such as automotive, retail, and others. These experiences, or configurators, can be distributed to a wide audience through the significant and varied platform compatibility of the Unity runtime.\\nOperate Solutions\\nOur Operate Solutions offer customers the ability to grow and engage their end-users, and to run and monetize their content, optimizing end-user acquisition and operational costs while increasing the lifetime value of their end-users.\\nUnity Software Inc.\\nUser Acquisition and Monetization\\nMany of our customers create games and applications with the purpose of building a profitable business. This requires both the acquisition of end-users at a reasonable cost and the monetization of these end-users as they engage over time with the content.\\nOur user acquisition products enable advertisers to efficiently acquire new end-users at scale. They operate within our monetization ecosystem, which reached over 2.6 billion monthly active end users as of December 31, 2020, making it one of the largest global user bases for advertisers. Our focus and strength are in pay-for-performance end-user acquisition, where advertisers pay us based on a tangible outcome or set goal, such as an install, rather than on a cost per impression basis. As a result, a large number of our advertisers have open spending limits with us as they can clearly measure the positive return on their spend.\\n•Personalized Advertising: an end-user acquisition product that uses machine learning combined with our deep player and game data to drive end-user installs at scale. Advertisers can define campaigns based on several parameters:\\n•Reach: advertisers define the amount they are willing to pay for each install. Our algorithm maximizes reach and identifies the audience with the highest propensity to install.\\n•Retention: our algorithms dynamically adjust the cost per install based on the likelihood of customer retention over 7-day, 14-day and other retention periods. This minimizes the risk that our customer will spend to acquire end-users that are unlikely to yield attractive returns, including those that churn almost immediately.\\n•Desired Return on Ad Spend (ROAS): our algorithms dynamically adjust the cost per install based on a combination of the ROAS target set by the advertiser and the predicted lifetime value of an end-user.\\n•Contextual Advertising: a product designed for cases in which our customers or their end-users opt-out of personalization within apps. With the depth and breadth of our in-game data, we can deliver highly relevant advertising while respecting stricter privacy elections.\\nOur monetization products generate revenue for our customers in two primary ways. First, we provide in-app advertising technology that connects our customers to a broad range of advertisers is powered by our Unified Auction. Second, we provide micro-transaction capabilities that enable revenue through in-app purchases, or IAP.\\n•Unity Ads: enables developers to seek the highest value for each impression of their inventory, through our Unified Auction, from a broad range of advertisers including direct Unity customers as well as demand side platforms, or DSPs. Each time an event is triggered within our customer’s application, our auction determines the best advertisement to show the end user. Customers can access Unity Ads through a software development kit that enables ad delivery, rendering, and transactions.\\n•Unity IAP: allows for the sale of virtual goods within free or paid games on all major platforms by enabling creators to create once and connect to all major platform stores (for example the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store), utilizing a convenient single integration.\\nUnity Software Inc.\\nEnd-User Engagement\\n\\nNet cash used in investing activities (575,190) (219,541) (40,043)\\nNet cash provided by financing activities 1,701,455 161,472 148,251\\nEffect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash 673 (172) (8)\\nNet change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ 1,146,851 $ (126,177) $ 27,141\\nCash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities\\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, cash provided by operating activities was $19.9 million, which consisted of a net loss of $282.3 million, adjusted by non-cash charges of $244.5 million and net cash inflows from the change in net operating assets and liabilities of $57.8 million. The non-cash charges primarily consisted of depreciation and amortization of $43.0 million, stock-based compensation of $134.6 million, and a common stock charitable donation expense of $63.6 million. The net cash inflows from the change in our net operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a $41.6 million increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, a $44.6 million increase in publisher payables, and a $37.4 million increase in deferred revenue. This was partially offset by a $63.3 million increase in accounts receivable and a $13.0 million increase in other current assets. A substantial portion of our accounts receivable balance comes from advertising partners and is offset by an accounts payable amount due to our publishers (Operate Solutions customers). However, the payment terms that we offer our advertising partners are generally shorter than the payment terms with our publishers (Operate Solutions customers). As such, our cash flows fluctuate from period to period due to revenue seasonality, timing of billings, collections, and publisher payments. Historical cash flows are not necessarily indicative of our results in any future period.\\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in operating activities was $67.9 million, which consisted of a net loss of $163.2 million, adjusted by non-cash charges of $75.7 million and net cash inflows from the change in net operating assets and liabilities of $19.5 million. The non-cash charges primarily consisted of stock-based compensation of $44.5 million and depreciation and amortization of $31.1 million. The net cash inflows from the change in our net operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a $31.1 million increase in deferred revenue, an increase in publisher payables of $20.2 million, and a $13.2 million increase in income and other taxes payable. This was partially offset by a $49.4 million increase in accounts receivable, all due to an increase in sales, including in the fourth quarter, which has historically been our strongest quarter for new business within our Create Solutions business and for usage levels within our Operate Solutions business.\\nCash Used in Investing Activities\\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, cash used in investing activities was $575.2 million, consisting of the purchase of marketable securities of $482.5 million, cash used in acquisitions of $53.2 million, and capital expenditures of $40.2 million.\\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in investing activities was $219.5 million, consisting of cash used in acquisitions of $192.5 million and capital expenditures of $27.0 million.\\nUnity Software Inc.\\nCash Provided by Financing Activities\\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, cash provided by financing activities was $1,701.5 million, primarily consisting of net proceeds of $1,417.6 million from our initial public offering, net proceeds of $250.0 million from the issuance of convertible preferred stock and common stock, proceeds of $125.0 million from the revolving loan facility, and proceeds of $25.4 million from the exercise of stock options. The net cash outflows from financing activities was primarily due to the $125.0 million repayment of principal on our revolving loan facility.\\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, cash provided by financing activities was $161.5 million, consisting of proceeds from the issuance of convertible preferred stock and common stock of $585.1 million and stock option exercises of $11.8 million, partially offset by $435.1 million used for the repurchase of our stock and the purchase of shares of our common stock and vested stock options pursuant to a tender offer, and $0.4 million of debt issuance costs in connection with our $125.0 million Credit Agreement.\\nContractual Obligations\\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 (in thousands):\\nPayments Due by Period\\nTotal Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 Years\\nOperating leases (1)\\n$ 141,762 $ 30,176 $ 49,567 $ 32,735 $ 29,284\\nPurchase commitments (2)\\n153,870 48,502 89,743 15,625 -\\nTotal (3)\\n$ 295,632 $ 78,678 $ 139,310 $ 48,360 $ 29,284\\n(1) Operating lease obligations consist primarily of obligations for real estate.\\n(2) The substantial majority of our purchase commitments are related to agreements with our data center hosting providers.\\n(3) This table generally excludes amounts related to income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions, since we cannot predict with reasonable reliability the timing of cash settlements to the respective taxing authorities.\\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\\nWe have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements and did not have any material holdings in variable interest entities as of December 31, 2020.\\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\\nManagement’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenue generated and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, and any such differences may be material. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management’s judgments and estimates.\\nUnity Software Inc.\\nRevenue Recognition\\nWe generate revenue through three sources: (1) Create Solutions, which is composed primarily of our subscription offerings and professional services; (2) Operate Solutions, which includes our monetization services, hosting, and multiplayer services, and voice services; and (3) Strategic Partnerships and Other, which are primarily arrangements with strategic hardware, operating system, device, game console, and other technology providers for the customization and development of our software to enable interoperability with these platforms.\\nWe evaluate and recognize revenue by:\\n•identifying the contract(s) with the customer;\\n•identifying the performance obligation(s) in the contract(s);\\n•determining the transaction price;\\n•allocating the transaction price to performance obligation(s) in the contract(s); and\\n•recognizing revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied through the transfer of a promised good or service to a customer which we refer to as a transfer of control.\\n\\nUnity Software Inc.\\nCreate Solutions\\nCreate Solutions Subscriptions\\nOur subscriptions, mainly consisting of Unity Pro and Unity Plus (collectively, the “Create Solutions subscriptions”) are fully integrated content development solutions that enable customers to build interactive real-time 2D and 3D applications. These Create Solutions subscriptions provide customers with the rights to a software license with embedded cloud functionality and multi-platform support. Significant judgment is required to determine the level of integration and interdependency between individual promises of the Create Solutions subscriptions. This determination influences whether the software is considered distinct and accounted for separately as a license performance obligation recognized at a point in time, or not distinct and accounted for together with other promises in the Create Solutions subscriptions as a single performance obligation recognized over time. Under Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“Topic 606”), we have concluded that the software license is not distinct from the multi-platform support as they are highly interdependent and interrelated considering the significant two-way dependency between the promises. Although the promise to the embedded cloud functionality represents separate performance obligations under Topic 606, we have accounted for these obligations as if they are a single performance obligation that includes the software license and the multi-platform support because the cloud functionality has the same pattern of transfer to the customer over the duration of the subscription term.\\nThe transaction price is determined based on the consideration that we will be entitled to receive in exchange for transferring our Create Solutions subscriptions to the customer, and we do not have material variable consideration. We recognize the single performance obligation ratably over the contract term beginning when the license key is delivered.\\nEnterprise customers may purchase an enhanced support offering (“Enterprise Support”) that is sold separately from the Create Solutions subscriptions, and is capable of being distinct, and is distinct within the context of the contract due to its separate utility. Enterprise Support is generally billed in advance and is recognized ratably over the support term as we have a stand-ready performance obligation over the support term. When an arrangement includes Enterprise Support and Create Solutions subscriptions, which have the same pattern of transfer to the customer (the services transfer to the customer over the same period), we account for those performance obligations as if they are a single performance obligation. If an arrangement includes Enterprise Support and Create Solutions subscriptions that do not have the same pattern of transfer, we allocate the transaction price to the distinct performance obligations and recognize them ratably over their respective terms.\\nCreate Solutions subscriptions typically have a term of one to three years and are generally billed in advance and recognized ratably over the term.\\nProfessional Services\\nOur professional services revenue is primarily composed of consulting, integration, training, and custom application and workflow development. Professional services may be billed in advance or on a time and materials basis and we recognize the related revenue as services are rendered.\\nWe typically invoice our customers up front or when promised services are delivered, and the payment terms vary by customer type and location. The term between billing and payment due dates is not significant. As a result, we have determined that our contracts do not include significant financing component.\\nCustomer billings related to taxes imposed by and remitted to governmental authorities on revenue-producing transactions are reported on a net basis.\\nUnity Software Inc.\\nOperate Solutions\\nMonetization\\nWe generate advertising revenue through our monetization solutions, including the Unified Auction, which allows publishers to sell the available advertising inventory from their mobile applications to advertisers. We enter into contracts with both advertisers and publishers to participate in the Unified Auction. For advertisements placed through the Unified Auction, we evaluate whether we are the principal (in which case revenue is reported on a gross basis) or the agent (in which case revenue is reported on a net basis). The evaluation to present revenue on a gross basis versus net basis requires significant judgment. We have concluded that the publisher is our customer and we are the agent in facilitating the fulfillment of the advertising inventory in the Unified Auction primarily because we do not control the advertising inventory prior to the placement of an advertisement. As the operator of the Unified Auction, our role is to enable the publisher to monetize its advertising inventory with the advertiser based on the bid/ask price from the auction. We do not control the outcome of the bids and do not have pricing latitude in the transaction. Based on these and other factors, we report advertising revenue based on the net amount retained from the transaction which is our revenue share. Advertising revenue is recognized at a point in time when control is transferred to the customer. This occurs when a user installs an application after seeing an advertisement contracted on a cost-per-install basis or when an advertisement starts on a cost-per-impression basis. Typically, we do not retain a share of the revenue generated through Unity IAP (“In-App Purchases”). Publisher payables represent amounts earned by publishers in the Unified Auction and are presented as a reduction of revenue in our consolidated statements of operations. Payment terms are contractually defined and vary by publisher and location.\\nCloud and Hosting Services\\nWe provide cloud-based services as well as enterprise hosting (“Hosting Services”) to developers that develop and operate multiuser/multiplayer games and applications through a combination of hardware server and cloud-based infrastructure and services. The Hosting Services facilitate the connection of end users, and allow content game and application operators to monitor network traffic. Our cloud-based services provide our customers with tools and services to develop and operate live games and applications, including voice chat services. We primarily sell these services on a fixed fee or usage-based model with fixed fees billed monthly in advance and usage fees billed monthly in arrears. We recognize revenue ratably over the contractual service term for fixed fee arrangements as we have a stand-ready performance obligation that is generally fulfilled evenly throughout the hosting period. We recognize revenue for usage-based arrangements as services are provided.\\nStrategic Partnerships and Other\\nWe enter into strategic contracts with owners of hardware, operating system, device, game console and other technology providers to customize our software licenses to enable interoperability with these platforms (“Strategic Partnerships”). This allows customers using our Create Solutions subscriptions to build and publish content to more than one platform without having to write platform-specific code. We consider these strategic partners as our customers and generally provide them with the following promises in our contracts: (i) development and customization of our software to integrate with the customer’s platform and (ii) post-integration ongoing support and updates.\\nHuman: What are the main revenue streams of unity software?\"\n",

    "### What is an AI agent ?\n",
    "An agentic employs a chain-of-thought reasoning process, where the LLM is prompted to think gradually through a question, interleaving its reasoning with the ability to use external tools such as search engines and APIs. This allows the LLM to retrieve relevant information that can help answer partial aspects of the question, ultimately leading to a more comprehensive and accurate final response. This approach is inspired by the \"Reason and Act\" (ReAct) design introduced in the paper [ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.03629)  which aims to synergize the reasoning capabilities of language models with the ability to interact with external resources and take actions. By combining these two facets, an agentic LLM assistant can provide more informed and well-rounded answers to complex user queries.\n",

    "![agent components](./static/agent-components.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why build an AI agent?\n",
    "In today's digital landscape, enterprises are inundated with a vast array of data sources, ranging from traditional PDF documents to complex SQL and NoSQL databases, and everything in between. While this wealth of information holds immense potential for gaining valuable insights and driving operational efficiency, the sheer volume and diversity of data can often pose significant challenges in terms of accessibility and utilization.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the power of agentic LLM assistants comes into play. By leveraging progress in LLM design patterns such as Reason and Act (ReAct) and other traditional or novel design patterns, these intelligent assistants are capable of integrating with an enterprise's diverse data sources. Through the development of specialized tools tailored to each data source and the ability of LLM agents to identify the right tool for a given question, agentic LLM assistants can simplify how you navigate and extract relevant information, regardless of its origin or structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "This enables a rich, multi-source conversation that promises to unlock the full potential of the entreprise data, enabling data-driven decision-making, enhancing operational efficiency, and ultimately driving productivity and growth.\n",
