    "Form 10-K is a comprehensive report filed annually by a publicly traded company about its financial performance and is required by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Some of the information a company is required to document in the 10-K includes its history, organizational structure, financial statements, earnings per share, subsidiaries, executive compensation, and any other relevant data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SEC mandates that all public companies file regular 10-Ks to keep investors aware of a company's financial condition and to allow them to have enough information before they buy or sell securities issued by that company. The 10-K can appear overly complex at first glance, complete with tables full of data and figures. However, it is so comprehensive that this filing is critical for investors to handle a company's financial position and prospects.\n",

    "In Vector search,documents and queries are represented as high-dimensional numerical vectors, rather than just as strings of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea behind vector search is that semantically similar documents or queries can be mapped to vectors that are close to each other in the vector space, even if the textual content doesn't have much lexical overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a bit more detail on how vector search works:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Documents are converted into numerical vector representations using machine learning models like word embeddings or document embeddings. These models learn to map words, phrases, or entire documents into a high-dimensional vector space.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Queries are also converted into vector form, allowing them to be compared to the document vectors in this mathematical vector space.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Rather than doing a simple keyword match, the search engine calculates the similarity between the query vector and each document vector, often using a metric like cosine similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The most similar document vectors are then returned as the search results, even if they don't contain the exact words from the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows vector search to uncover semantically relevant content that would be missed by traditional text-based searches. It's especially useful for tasks like question answering, e-commerce search, and retrieval of similar documents or images.\n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying machine learning models need to be trained on large datasets, but vector search can significantly improve the quality and relevance of search results compared to purely lexical approaches.\n",

    "**Embeddings** are numerical representations of data, typically used to convert complex, high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space where similar data points are closer together. In the context of natural language processing (NLP), embeddings are used to represent words, phrases, or sentences as vectors of real numbers. These vectors capture semantic relationships, meaning that words with similar meanings are represented by vectors that are close together in the embedding space.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Embedding models** are machine learning models that are trained to create these numerical representations. They learn to encode various types of data into embeddings that capture the essential characteristics and relationships within the data. For example, in NLP, embedding models like Word2Vec, GloVe, and BERT are trained on large text corpora to produce word embeddings. These embeddings can then be used for various downstream tasks, such as text classification, sentiment analysis, or machine translation. In this case we'll be using it for semantic similarity\n",

    "You can leverage the Large Language Models to generate answers rather than provinding the document back to the user. By provinding these retrieved documents as context to generate answers, we minimizes the halucination. This method is called Retrieval Augmented Generation or simply RAG. In RAG, external data can be sourced from various data sources, such as document repositories, databases, or APIs. The first step is to convert the documents and the user query into a format that enables comparison and allows for performing relevancy search. To achieve comparability for relevancy search, a document collection (knowledge library) and the user-submitted query are transformed into numerical representations using embedding language models. These embeddings are essentially numerical representations of concepts in text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, based on the embedding of the user query, relevant text is identified in the document collection through similarity search in the embedding space. The prompt provided by the user is then combined with the searched relevant text and added to the context. This updated prompt, which includes relevant external data along with the original prompt, is sent to the LLM (Language Model) for processing. As a result, the model output becomes relevant and accurate due to the context containing the relevant external data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The major components of RAG, including embedding, vector databases, augmentation, and generation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Embedding**: Purpose: Embeddings transform text data into numerical vectors in a high-dimensional space. These vectors represent the semantic meaning of the text. Process: The embedding process typically uses pre-trained models (like BERT or a variant) to convert both the input queries and the documents in the database into dense vectors. Role in RAG: Embeddings are crucial for the retrieval component as they allow the model to compute the similarity between the query and the documents in the database efficiently.\n",
    "- **Vector Database**: Function: A vector database stores the embeddings of a large collection of documents or passages. Construction: It is created by processing a vast corpus (like Wikipedia or other specialized datasets) through an embedding model. Usage in RAG: When a query comes in, the model searches this database to find the documents whose embeddings are most similar to the embedding of the query.\n",
    "- **Retrieval (Augmentation)**: Mechanism: The retrieval part of RAG functions by taking the input query, converting it into a vector using embeddings, and then searching the vector database to retrieve relevant documents. Result: It augments the original query with additional context by selecting documents or passages that are semantically related to the query. This augmented information is essential for generating more informed responses.\n",
    "- **Generation**: Integration with a Language Model: The generative component, often a large language model like Amazon Titan Text, receives both the original query and the retrieved documents. Response Generation: It synthesizes information from these inputs to produce a coherent and contextually appropriate response. \n",
    "- **Training and Fine-Tuning**: This component is generally pre-trained on vast amounts of text and may be further fine-tuned to optimize its performance for specific tasks or datasets.\n",
    "- **End-to-End Training (Optional)**: Joint Optimization: In RAG, both retrieval and generation components can be fine-tuned together, allowing the system to optimize the selection of documents and the generation of responses simultaneously. Feedback Loop: The model learns not only to generate relevant responses but also to retrieve the most useful documents for any given query.\n",

We offer a line of products and services used by creative professionals including photographers, video editors, designers and developers; communicators including content creators, students, marketers and knowledge workers; businesses of all sizes; and consumers for creating, managing, delivering, measuring, optimizing, engaging and transacting with compelling content and experiences across personal computers, devices and media. We market our products and services directly to enterprise customers through our sales force and local field offices. We license our products to end users through app stores and our own website at www.adobe.com. We offer many of our products via a Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) model or a managed services model (both of which are referred to as hosted or cloud-based) as well as through term subscription and pay-per-use models. We also distribute certain products and services through a network of distributors, value-added resellers (“VARs”), systems integrators (“SIs”), independent software vendors (“ISVs”), retailers, software developers and original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”). In addition, we license our technology to hardware manufacturers, software developers and service providers for use in their products and solutions. Our products run on personal and server-based computers, as well as on smartphones, tablets and other devices, depending on the product. We have operations in the Americas; Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”); and Asia-Pacific (“APAC”).\\nAdobe was originally incorporated in California in October 1983 and was reincorporated in Delaware in May 1997. Our executive offices and principal facilities are located at 345 Park Avenue, San Jose, California 95110-2704. Our telephone number is 408-536-6000 and our website is www.adobe.com. Investors can obtain copies of our SEC filings from this site free of charge, as well as from the SEC website at www.sec.gov. The information posted to our website is not incorporated into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nBUSINESS OVERVIEW\\nFor over 35 years, Adobe’s innovations have transformed how individuals, teams, businesses and governments engage and interact with their constituents in print and online. We help our customers create and deliver the most compelling experiences in streamlined workflows and optimize those experiences for greater return on investment. Our solutions turn ordinary interactions into valuable digital experiences, across media and devices, anytime, anywhere.\\nWhile we continue to offer a broad portfolio of products, services and solutions, we focus our investments in two strategic growth areas:\\nDigital Media - providing products, services and solutions that enable individuals, teams and enterprises to create, publish and promote their content anywhere and accelerate their productivity by modernizing how they view, share and engage with documents and creative content. Our customers include creative professionals like photographers, video editors, graphic and experience designers, and app and game developers; communicators like content creators, students, marketers and knowledge workers who create, collaborate on and distribute documents and creative content; and consumers. This is the core of what we have delivered for decades, and we have evolved our business model to provide our customers with a range of\\nflexible solutions that allow them to reach their full creative potential anytime, anywhere, on any device, and on projects of all types.\\nDigital Experience - providing a comprehensive and integrated platform and set of applications and services through Adobe Experience Cloud that enable brands and businesses of all sizes to create, manage, execute, measure, monetize and optimize customer experiences that span from analytics to commerce. Our customers include marketers, advertisers, agencies, publishers, merchandisers, merchants, web analysts, data scientists, developers, marketing executives, information management and technology executives, product development executives and sales and support executives. Underpinning Adobe Experience Cloud is our Adobe Experience Platform, which provides businesses and brands with an open and extensible platform for customer experience management that transforms customer data into real-time robust customer profiles and uses insights driven by artificial intelligence (“AI”) to enable the delivery of personalized digital experiences in milliseconds. By combining the creativity of our Digital Media business with the science of our Digital Experience offerings, we help our customers more efficiently and effectively make, manage, measure and monetize their content across channels and devices with an end-to-end workflow and feedback loop.\\nWe believe we are uniquely positioned to be a leader in both the Digital Media and Digital Experience markets, where our mission to change the world through digital experiences has never been more relevant, as people seek new ways to communicate, learn and conduct business virtually. By integrating products from each of these areas, our customers are able to utilize a comprehensive suite of solutions and services that no other company currently offers. In addition, our ability to deliver innovation and productivity improvements across customer workflows involving the creation, management, delivery, measurement and optimization of engaging content favorably positions Adobe as our customers continue to invest in delivering digital experiences.\\nSEGMENTS\\nOur business is organized into three reportable segments: Digital Media, Digital Experience and Publishing and Advertising. These segments provide Adobe’s senior management with a comprehensive financial view of our key businesses. Our segments are aligned around our two strategic growth opportunities further described below, placing our Publishing and Advertising business in a third segment that contains some of our legacy products and solutions.\\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we moved our Adobe Advertising Cloud offerings from our Digital Experience segment into our Publishing and Advertising segment in order to more closely align our Digital Experience business with our strategic growth priorities.\\nMARKET OVERVIEW\\nThis overview provides an explanation of our markets and a discussion of strategic opportunities in fiscal 2021 and beyond for each of our segments. See “Results of Operations” within Part II, Item 7 titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 2 of Part II, Item 8 titled “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for further segment information.\\nDigital Media\\nDigital Media Opportunity\\nRecent technology trends in digital communications continue to provide a significant market opportunity for Adobe in digital media. Everyone has a story to tell - from creative professionals, to communicators, to consumers - and with content creation and consumption exploding across every type of device, they need the tools to tell those stories on an ever-increasing number of canvasses. In today’s world where the velocity of creation and consumption of digital content is constantly growing, design and creativity have never been more relevant and customers are looking for a way to meet demand with engaging online experiences. Adobe is in a strong position to capitalize on this opportunity with innovation that will accelerate the creative process across all platforms and devices, deepen engagement with communities and accelerate long-term revenue growth by focusing on cloud-based offerings, which are licensed on a subscription basis.\\n\\nPurchases of long-term investments, intangibles and other assets (15) (49) (18)\\nProceeds from sales of long-term investments and other assets 9 3 5\\nNet cash used for investing activities (414) (456) (4,685)\\nCash flows from financing activities:\\nPurchases of treasury stock (3,050) (2,750) (2,050)\\nProceeds from re-issuance of treasury stock 270 233 191\\nTaxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards (681) (440) (393)\\nProceeds from issuance of debt 3,144 - 2,248\\nRepayment of debt (3,150) - -\\nOther financing activities, net (21) 11 (1)\\nNet cash used for financing activities (3,488) (2,946) (5)\\nEffect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents 3 (13) (2)\\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 1,828 1,007 (663)\\nCash and cash equivalents at beginning of year 2,650 1,643 2,306\\nCash and cash equivalents at end of year $ 4,478 $ 2,650 $ 1,643\\nSupplemental disclosures:\\nCash paid for income taxes, net of refunds $ 469 $ 352 $ 210\\nCash paid for interest $ 88 $ 152 $ 81\\nNon-cash investing activities:\\nIssuance of common stock and stock awards assumed in business acquisitions $ - $ - $ 3\\nSee accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\\nADOBE INC.\\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nNOTE 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\\nOperations\\nFounded in 1982, Adobe Inc. is one of the largest and most diversified software companies in the world. We offer a line of products and services used by creative professionals, marketers, knowledge workers, students, application developers, enterprises and consumers for creating, managing, delivering, measuring, optimizing, engaging and transacting with compelling content and experiences across personal computers, devices and media.

We have operations in the Americas; Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”); and Asia-Pacific (“APAC”).\\nBasis of Presentation\\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include those of Adobe and its subsidiaries, after elimination of all intercompany accounts and transactions. We have prepared the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).\\nUse of Estimates\\nIn preparing Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, we must make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, sales allowances and programs, bad debts, stock-based compensation, determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, litigation and income taxes. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates.\\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a disease caused by a novel strain of the coronavirus (COVID-19) to be a pandemic. This pandemic has created and may continue to create significant uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment which, in addition to other unforeseen effects of this pandemic, may adversely impact our results of operations. As a result, most of our estimates and assumptions may require increased judgment and carry a higher degree of variability and volatility. As events continue to evolve and additional information becomes available, our estimates may change materially in future periods.\\nFiscal Year\\nOur fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week year that ends on the Friday closest to November 30. Fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018 were 52-week years.\\nADOBE INC.\\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\\nReclassifications\\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we moved our Advertising Cloud offerings from our Digital Experience segment into our new Publishing and Advertising segment, which combined our Advertising Cloud offerings with our previous Publishing segment. This realignment is consistent with how we manage our Digital Experience segment to better reflect the strategic shift related to Advertising Cloud and to align with our overall core value proposition of delivering on customer experience management.\\nFurther, we reclassified revenue and related cost of revenue of our Advertising Cloud offerings from subscription to services and other on our Consolidated Statements of Income.\\nFinancial information for all fiscal years presented has been updated in our Consolidated Financial Statements to reflect these reclassifications. If the change was made at the beginning of fiscal 2020, reported revenue and cost of revenue in our income statements for each quarter of fiscal 2020 would have been as follows:\\nQuarter Ended\\nYear Ended\\n(in millions) February 28 May 29 August 28 November 27 November 27\\nRevenue:\\nSubscription $ 2,732 $ 2,831 $ 2,948 $ 3,115 $ 11,626\\nProduct 143 128 109 127 507\\nServices and other 216 169 168 182 735\\nTotal revenue 3,091 3,128 3,225 3,424 12,868\\nCost of revenue:\\nSubscription 274 269 282 283 1,108\\nProduct 7 9 10 10 36\\nServices and other 171 137 135 135 578\\nTotal cost of revenue $ 452 $ 415 $ 427 $ 428 $ 1,722\\nCertain other immaterial prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\\nSignificant Accounting Policies\\nRevenue Recognition\\nOur revenue is derived from the sale of cloud-enabled software subscriptions, cloud-hosted offerings, term-based, royalty, and perpetual software licenses, associated software maintenance and support plans, consulting services, training and technical support. Most of our enterprise customer arrangements involve multiple promises to our customers.\\nRevenue is recognized when a contract exists between us and a customer and upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which may be capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations, or in the case of offerings such as cloud-enabled Creative Cloud and Document Cloud, accounted for as a single performance obligation. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.\\nSubscription, Product and Services Offerings\\nWe enter into revenue arrangements in which a customer may purchase a combination of cloud-enabled subscriptions, cloud-hosted offerings, term-based, royalty, and perpetual software licenses, associated software maintenance and support plans, consulting services, training and technical support.\\nADOBE INC.\\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\\n\\n•Operating expenses of $6.91 billion increased by $679 million, or 11%, during fiscal 2020, from $6.23 billion in fiscal 2019 primarily due to increases in base and incentive compensation and related benefits costs, as well as increased marketing spend. These increases were offset in part by decreases in travel-related expenses.\\n•Net income of $5.26 billion increased by $2.31 billion, or 78%, during fiscal 2020 from $2.95 billion in fiscal 2019 primarily due to increases in revenue and the non-recurring benefit from income taxes resulting from intra-entity transfers of certain intellectual property rights.\\n•Net cash flows from operations of $5.73 billion during fiscal 2020 increased by $1.31 billion, or 30%, from $4.42 billion during fiscal 2019 primarily due to higher net income adjusted for the net effect of non-cash items.\\nPresentation Changes\\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we moved our Advertising Cloud offerings from our Digital Experience segment into our new Publishing and Advertising segment, which combined our Advertising Cloud offerings with our previous Publishing segment. This realignment is consistent with how we manage our Digital Experience segment to better reflect the strategic shift related to Advertising Cloud and to align with our overall core value proposition of delivering on customer experience management.\\nFurther, we reclassified revenue and related cost of revenue of our Advertising Cloud offerings from subscription to services and other on our Consolidated Statements of Income.\\nFinancial information for all fiscal years presented has been updated to reflect these reclassifications. There were no other updates to disclosures included in our prior year report in relation to the reclassifications.\\nRevenue\\nOur financial results for fiscal 2020 and 2019 are presented in accordance with Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which was adopted under the modified retrospective method at the beginning of fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2018 results have not been restated which limits its comparability with other fiscal years presented.\\n(dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2018 % Change\\n2020-2019 % Change\\n2019-2018\\nSubscription $ 11,626 $ 9,634 $ 7,604 21 % 27 %\\nPercentage of total revenue 90 % 86 % 84 %\\nProduct 507 648 622 (22) % 4 %\\nPercentage of total revenue 4 % 6 % 7 %\\nServices and other 735 889 804 (17) % 11 %\\nPercentage of total revenue 6 % 8 % 9 %\\nTotal revenue $ 12,868 $ 11,171 $ 9,030 15 % 24 %\\nSubscription\\nOur subscription revenue is comprised primarily of fees we charge for our subscription and hosted service offerings, and related support, including Creative Cloud and certain of our Adobe Experience Cloud and Document Cloud services. We primarily recognize subscription revenue ratably over the term of agreements with our customers, beginning with commencement of service. Subscription revenue related to certain offerings, where fees are based on a number of transactions and invoicing is aligned to the pattern of performance, customer benefit and consumption, are recognized on a usage basis.\\nWe have the following reportable segments: Digital Media, Digital Experience, and Publishing and Advertising. Subscription revenue by reportable segment for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 is as follows:\\n(dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2018 % Change\\n2020-2019 % Change\\n2019-2018\\nDigital Media $ 8,813 $ 7,208 $ 5,858 22 % 23 %\\nDigital Experience 2,660 2,280 1,600 17 % 43 %\\nPublishing and Advertising 153 146 146 5 % *\\nTotal subscription revenue $ 11,626 $ 9,634 $ 7,604 21 % 27 %\\n_________________________________________\\n(*) Percentage is less than 1%.\\nProduct\\nOur product revenue is comprised primarily of fees related to licenses for on-premise software purchased on a perpetual basis, for a fixed period of time or based on usage for certain of our OEM and royalty agreements. We primarily recognize\\nproduct revenue at the point in time the software is available to the customer, provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met.\\nServices and Other\\nOur services and other revenue is comprised primarily of fees related to consulting, training, maintenance and support and our advertising offerings. We typically sell our consulting contracts on a time-and-materials and fixed-fee basis. These revenues are recognized as the services are performed for time and materials contracts and on a relative performance basis for fixed-fee contracts. Training revenues are recognized as the services are performed. Our maintenance and support offerings, which entitle customers, partners and developers to receive desktop product upgrades and enhancements or technical support, depending on the offering, are generally recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement. Transaction-based advertising revenue is recognized on a usage basis as we satisfy the performance obligations to our customers.\\nSegments\\nIn fiscal 2020, we categorized our products into the following reportable segments:\\n•Digital Media-Our Digital Media segment provides tools and solutions that enable individuals, teams and enterprises to create, publish, promote and monetize their digital content anywhere.

Document Cloud ARR exiting fiscal 2020 was $1.46 billion, up from $1.08 billion at the end of fiscal 2019. Total Digital Media ARR grew to $10.18 billion at the end of fiscal 2020, up from $8.33 billion at the end of fiscal 2019. Revaluing our ending ARR for fiscal 2020 using currency rates at the beginning of fiscal 2021, our Digital Media ARR at the end of fiscal 2020 would be $10.26 billion or approximately $77 million higher than the ARR reported above.\\nOur success in driving growth in ARR has positively affected our revenue growth. Creative revenue in fiscal 2020 was $7.74 billion, up from $6.48 billion in fiscal 2019 and representing 19% year-over-year growth. Document Cloud revenue in fiscal 2020 was $1.50 billion, up from $1.22 billion in fiscal 2019 and representing 22% year-over-year revenue growth and reflecting an increase in demand driven by the shift to remote work as well as our continued efforts to transition Document Cloud to a subscription-based model. Total Digital Media segment revenue grew to $9.23 billion in fiscal 2020, up from $7.71 billion in fiscal 2019 and representing 20% year-over-year growth. These increases were driven by strong net new user growth, including those resulting from the current work-from-home environment reflecting expanded digital engagement.\\nDigital Experience\\nWe are a market leader in the fast-growing category addressed by our Digital Experience segment. The Adobe Experience Cloud applications, services and platform are designed to manage customer journeys, enable shoppable experiences and deliver intelligence for businesses of any size in any industry. Our differentiation and competitive advantage is strengthened by our ability to use the Adobe Experience Platform to connect our comprehensive set of solutions.\\nAdobe Experience Cloud is focused on delivering solutions for our enterprise customers across the following strategic growth pillars:\\n•Customer data and insights. Our solutions deliver real-time customer profiles and intelligence across the customer journey. Our offerings include Adobe Experience Platform, Adobe Analytics, Adobe Audience Manager, Customer Journey Analytics, Real-time Customer Data Platform and Intelligent Services.\\n•Content and commerce. Our solutions to help customers manage, deliver, test, target and optimize content delivery and enable shopping experiences that scale from mid-market to enterprise businesses. Our offerings include Adobe Experience Manager, Adobe Target and Adobe Commerce.\\n•Customer journey management. Our solutions help businesses manage, personalize and orchestrate campaigns and customer journeys across B2E use cases. Our offerings include Adobe Campaign, Marketo Engage and Journey Orchestration.\\nIn addition to chief marketing officers, chief revenue officers and digital marketers, users of our Digital Experience solutions include advertisers, campaign managers, publishers, data analysts, content managers, social marketers, marketing executives and information management and technology executives. These customers often are involved in workflows that utilize other Adobe products, such as our Digital Media offerings. By combining the creativity of our Digital Media business\\nwith the science of our Digital Experience business, we help our customers to more efficiently and effectively make, manage, measure and monetize their content across every channel with an end-to-end workflow and feedback loop.\\nWe utilize a direct sales force to market and license our Digital Experience solutions, as well as an extensive ecosystem of partners, including marketing agencies, systems integrators and independent software vendors that help license and deploy our solutions to their customers. We have made significant investments to broaden the scale and size of all of these routes to market, and our recent financial results reflect the success of these investments.\\nDigital Experience revenue for all fiscal years presented has been updated to reflect the Advertising Cloud segment move. Digital Experience revenue was $3.13 billion in fiscal 2020, up from $2.80 billion in fiscal 2019 which represents 12% year-over-year growth. Driving this increase was the increase in subscription revenue across our offerings which grew to $2.66 billion in fiscal 2020 from $2.28 billion in fiscal 2019, representing 17% year-over-year growth.\\nCOVID-19 UPDATE\\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a disease caused by a novel strain of the coronavirus (COVID-19) to be a pandemic. This pandemic has had widespread, rapidly-evolving and unpredictable impacts on global societies, economies, financial markets and business practices. Federal and state governments have implemented measures in an effort to contain the virus, including physical distancing, travel restrictions, border closures, limitations on public gatherings, work from home, supply chain logistical changes and closure of non-essential businesses. Our focus remains on promoting employee health and safety, serving our customers and ensuring business continuity. As a result, we have taken action to direct our teams to work from home, suspend travel and replace in-person events such as Adobe Summit and MAX, with digital events through July 2021.\\nDuring the pandemic, digital has become the primary way for people to connect, work, learn and be entertained, and for businesses to engage with customers. This macro trend towards all things digital has increased the importance and relevance of our solutions and accelerated the tailwinds that benefit our business, which contributed to our continued growth year over year. However, while our revenue and earnings are relatively predictable as a result of our subscription-based business model, the broader implications of the pandemic on our results of operations and overall financial performance remain uncertain. See Risk Factors for further discussion of the possible impact of the pandemic on our business.\\nFinancial Performance Summary for Fiscal 2020\\n•Total Digital Media ARR of approximately $10.18 billion as of November 27, 2020 increased by $1.85 billion, or 22%, from $8.33 billion as of November 29, 2019. The increase in our Digital Media ARR was primarily due to new user adoption of our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings.\\n•Creative revenue of $7.74 billion increased by $1.25 billion, or 19%, during fiscal 2020, from $6.48 billion in fiscal 2019. Document Cloud revenue of $1.50 billion increased by $272 million, or 22%, during fiscal 2020, from $1.22 billion in fiscal 2019. The increases were primarily due to subscription revenue growth associated with our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings.\\n•Digital Experience revenue of $3.13 billion increased by $330 million, or 12%, during fiscal 2020, from $2.80 billion in fiscal 2019. The increase was primarily due to subscription revenue growth across our offerings.\\n•Remaining performance obligation of $11.34 billion as of November 27, 2020 increased by $1.52 billion, or 15%, from $9.82 billion as of November 29, 2019, primarily due to new contracts and renewals for our Digital Media and Digital Experience offerings.\\n•Cost of revenue of $1.72 billion increased by $49 million, or 3%, during fiscal 2020, from $1.67 billion in fiscal 2019 primarily due to increases in hosting services and data center costs, offset in large part by decreases in Advertising Cloud media costs.\\n\\nADOBE INC.\\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\\nFully hosted subscription services (SaaS) allow customers to access hosted software during the contractual term without taking possession of the software. Cloud-hosted subscription services may be sold on a fee-per-subscription period basis or based on consumption or usage.\\nWe recognize revenue ratably over the contractual service term for hosted services that are priced based on a committed number of transactions where the delivery and consumption of the benefit of the services occur evenly over time, beginning on the date the services associated with the committed transactions are first made available to the customer and continuing through the end of the contractual service term. Over-usage fees and fees based on the actual number of transactions are billed in accordance with contract terms as these fees are incurred and are included in the transaction price of an arrangement as variable consideration. Fees based on a number of transactions, where invoicing is aligned to the pattern of performance, customer benefit and consumption, are typically accounted for utilizing the “as-invoiced” practical expedient. Revenue for subscriptions sold as a fee per period is recognized ratably over the contractual term as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit of the underlying service.\\nWhen cloud-enabled services are highly integrated and interrelated with on-premise software, such as in our cloud-enabled Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings, the individual components are not considered distinct and revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period for which the cloud-enabled services are provided.\\nThe subscription support plans related to those customer arrangements whose revenues we classify as subscription revenues represent stand-ready performance obligations. Revenue from these subscription support plans is recognized ratably over their respective contractual terms and classified as subscription revenue.\\nLicenses for on-premise software may be purchased on a perpetual basis, as a subscription for a fixed period of time or based on usage for certain of our OEM and royalty agreements. Revenue from distinct on-premise licenses is recognized at the point in time the software is available to the customer, provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met, and classified as product revenue on our Consolidated Statements of Income. Some of our enterprise license arrangements allow customers to commit non-cancellable funds. These non-cancellable committed funds are nonrefundable and provide our customers options to either renew monthly on-premise term-based licenses or use some or all funds to purchase other Adobe products or services. Revenue associated with these monthly term-based licenses and associated maintenance and support is classified as subscription revenue.\\nOur services and other revenue is comprised primarily of fees related to consulting, training, maintenance and support and our advertising offerings. We typically sell our consulting contracts on a time-and-materials and fixed-fee basis. These revenues are recognized as the services are performed for time and materials contracts and on a relative performance basis for fixed-fee contracts. Training revenues are recognized as the services are performed. Our maintenance and support offerings, which entitle customers, partners and developers to receive desktop product upgrades and enhancements or technical support, depending on the offering, are generally recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement. Our transaction-based advertising offerings, where fees are based on a number of impressions per month and invoicing is aligned to the pattern of performance, customer benefit and consumption, are typically accounted for utilizing the “as-invoiced” practical expedient.\\nWe exclude from the transaction price sales and other taxes collected from customers on behalf of the relevant government authority. Most of our products are delivered electronically, however in instances where shipping and handling costs are incurred, we treat these amounts as costs to fulfill the contract and they are not considered a performance obligation and the associated fees are not included in the transaction price.\\nJudgments\\nOur contracts with customers may include multiple goods and services. For example, some of our offerings include both on-premise and/or on-device software licenses and cloud services. Determining whether the software licenses and the cloud services are distinct from each other, and therefore performance obligations to be accounted for separately, or not distinct from each other, and therefore part of a single performance obligation, may require significant judgment. We have concluded that the on-premise/on-device software licenses and cloud services provided in our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud subscription offerings are not distinct from each other such that revenue from each offering should be recognized ratably over the subscription period for which the cloud services are provided. In reaching this conclusion, we considered the nature of our promise to Creative Cloud and Document Cloud customers, which is to provide a complete end-to-end creative design or\\nADOBE INC.\\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\\ndocument workflow solution that operates seamlessly across multiple devices and teams. We fulfill this promise by providing access to a solution that integrates cloud-based and on-premise/on-device features that, together through their integration, provide functionalities, utility and workflow efficiencies that could not be obtained from either the on-premise/on-device software or cloud services on their own.\\nCloud-based features that are integral to our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings and that work together with the on-premise/on-device software include, but are not limited to: Creative Cloud Libraries, which enable customers to access their work, settings, preferences and other assets seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices and collaborate across teams in real time; shared reviews which enable simultaneous editing and commenting of PDFs across desktop, mobile and web; automatic cloud rendering of a design which enables it to be worked on in multiple mediums; and Sensei, Adobe’s cloud-hosted artificial intelligence and machine learning framework, which enables features such as automated photo-editing, photograph content-awareness, natural language processing, optical character recognition and automated document tagging.\\nStandalone selling price is established by maximizing the amount of observable inputs, primarily actual historical selling prices for performance obligations where available, and includes consideration of factors such as go-to-market model and geography. Individual products may have multiple values for standalone selling price depending on factors such as where they are sold and what channel they are sold through. Where standalone selling price may not be directly observable (e.g., the performance obligation is not sold separately), we maximize the use of observable inputs by using information that may include reviewing pricing practices, performance obligations with similar customers and selling models.\"\n",

We market our products and services directly to enterprise customers through our sales force and local field offices. We license our products to end users through app stores and our own website at www.adobe.com. We offer many of our products via a Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) model or a managed services model (both of which are referred to as hosted or cloud-based) as well as through term subscription and pay-per-use models. We also distribute certain products and services through a network of distributors, value-added resellers (“VARs”), systems integrators (“SIs”), independent software vendors (“ISVs”), retailers, software developers and original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”). In addition, we license our technology to hardware manufacturers, software developers and service providers for use in their products and solutions. Our products run on personal and server-based computers, as well as on smartphones, tablets and other devices, depending on the product. We have operations in the Americas; Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”); and Asia-Pacific (“APAC”).\\nAdobe was originally incorporated in California in October 1983 and was reincorporated in Delaware in May 1997. Our executive offices and principal facilities are located at 345 Park Avenue, San Jose, California 95110-2704. Our telephone number is 408-536-6000 and our website is www.adobe.com.

We help our customers create and deliver the most compelling experiences in streamlined workflows and optimize those experiences for greater return on investment. Our solutions turn ordinary interactions into valuable digital experiences, across media and devices, anytime, anywhere.\\nWhile we continue to offer a broad portfolio of products, services and solutions, we focus our investments in two strategic growth areas:\\nDigital Media - providing products, services and solutions that enable individuals, teams and enterprises to create, publish and promote their content anywhere and accelerate their productivity by modernizing how they view, share and engage with documents and creative content. Our customers include creative professionals like photographers, video editors, graphic and experience designers, and app and game developers; communicators like content creators, students, marketers and knowledge workers who create, collaborate on and distribute documents and creative content; and consumers. This is the core of what we have delivered for decades, and we have evolved our business model to provide our customers with a range of\\nflexible solutions that allow them to reach their full creative potential anytime, anywhere, on any device, and on projects of all types.\\nDigital Experience - providing a comprehensive and integrated platform and set of applications and services through Adobe Experience Cloud that enable brands and businesses of all sizes to create, manage, execute, measure, monetize and optimize customer experiences that span from analytics to commerce. Our customers include marketers, advertisers, agencies, publishers, merchandisers, merchants, web analysts, data scientists, developers, marketing executives, information management and technology executives, product development executives and sales and support executives. Underpinning Adobe Experience Cloud is our Adobe Experience Platform, which provides businesses and brands with an open and extensible platform for customer experience management that transforms customer data into real-time robust customer profiles and uses insights driven by artificial intelligence (“AI”) to enable the delivery of personalized digital experiences in milliseconds. By combining the creativity of our Digital Media business with the science of our Digital Experience offerings, we help our customers more efficiently and effectively make, manage, measure and monetize their content across channels and devices with an end-to-end workflow and feedback loop.\\nWe believe we are uniquely positioned to be a leader in both the Digital Media and Digital Experience markets, where our mission to change the world through digital experiences has never been more relevant, as people seek new ways to communicate, learn and conduct business virtually. By integrating products from each of these areas, our customers are able to utilize a comprehensive suite of solutions and services that no other company currently offers. In addition, our ability to deliver innovation and productivity improvements across customer workflows involving the creation, management, delivery, measurement and optimization of engaging content favorably positions Adobe as our customers continue to invest in delivering digital experiences.\\nSEGMENTS\\nOur business is organized into three reportable segments: Digital Media, Digital Experience and Publishing and Advertising. These segments provide Adobe’s senior management with a comprehensive financial view of our key businesses. Our segments are aligned around our two strategic growth opportunities further described below, placing our Publishing and Advertising business in a third segment that contains some of our legacy products and solutions.\\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we moved our Adobe Advertising Cloud offerings from our Digital Experience segment into our Publishing and Advertising segment in order to more closely align our Digital Experience business with our strategic growth priorities.\\nMARKET OVERVIEW\\nThis overview provides an explanation of our markets and a discussion of strategic opportunities in fiscal 2021 and beyond for each of our segments. See “Results of Operations” within Part II, Item 7 titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 2 of Part II, Item 8 titled “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for further segment information.\\nDigital Media\\nDigital Media Opportunity\\nRecent technology trends in digital communications continue to provide a significant market opportunity for Adobe in digital media. Everyone has a story to tell - from creative professionals, to communicators, to consumers - and with content creation and consumption exploding across every type of device, they need the tools to tell those stories on an ever-increasing number of canvasses. In today’s world where the velocity of creation and consumption of digital content is constantly growing, design and creativity have never been more relevant and customers are looking for a way to meet demand with engaging online experiences. Adobe is in a strong position to capitalize on this opportunity with innovation that will accelerate the creative process across all platforms and devices, deepen engagement with communities and accelerate long-term revenue growth by focusing on cloud-based offerings, which are licensed on a subscription basis.\\n\\nPurchases of long-term investments, intangibles and other assets (15) (49) (18)\\nProceeds from sales of long-term investments and other assets 9 3 5\\nNet cash used for investing activities (414) (456) (4,685)\\nCash flows from financing activities:\\nPurchases of treasury stock (3,050) (2,750) (2,050)\\nProceeds from re-issuance of treasury stock 270 233 191\\nTaxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards (681) (440) (393)\\nProceeds from issuance of debt 3,144 - 2,248\\nRepayment of debt (3,150) - -\\nOther financing activities, net (21) 11 (1)\\nNet cash used for financing activities (3,488) (2,946) (5)\\nEffect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents 3 (13) (2)\\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 1,828 1,007 (663)\\nCash and cash equivalents at beginning of year 2,650 1,643 2,306\\nCash and cash equivalents at end of year $ 4,478 $ 2,650 $ 1,643\\nSupplemental disclosures:\\nCash paid for income taxes, net of refunds $ 469 $ 352 $ 210\\nCash paid for interest $ 88 $ 152 $ 81\\nNon-cash investing activities:\\nIssuance of common stock and stock awards assumed in business acquisitions $ - $ - $ 3\\nSee accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\\nADOBE INC.\\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nNOTE 1.

We have operations in the Americas; Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”); and Asia-Pacific (“APAC”).\\nBasis of Presentation\\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include those of Adobe and its subsidiaries, after elimination of all intercompany accounts and transactions. We have prepared the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).\\nUse of Estimates\\nIn preparing Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, we must make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, sales allowances and programs, bad debts, stock-based compensation, determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, litigation and income taxes. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates.\\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a disease caused by a novel strain of the coronavirus (COVID-19) to be a pandemic. This pandemic has created and may continue to create significant uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment which, in addition to other unforeseen effects of this pandemic, may adversely impact our results of operations. As a result, most of our estimates and assumptions may require increased judgment and carry a higher degree of variability and volatility. As events continue to evolve and additional information becomes available, our estimates may change materially in future periods.\\nFiscal Year\\nOur fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week year that ends on the Friday closest to November 30. Fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018 were 52-week years.\\nADOBE INC.\\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\\nReclassifications\\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we moved our Advertising Cloud offerings from our Digital Experience segment into our new Publishing and Advertising segment, which combined our Advertising Cloud offerings with our previous Publishing segment. This realignment is consistent with how we manage our Digital Experience segment to better reflect the strategic shift related to Advertising Cloud and to align with our overall core value proposition of delivering on customer experience management.\\nFurther, we reclassified revenue and related cost of revenue of our Advertising Cloud offerings from subscription to services and other on our Consolidated Statements of Income.\\nFinancial information for all fiscal years presented has been updated in our Consolidated Financial Statements to reflect these reclassifications. If the change was made at the beginning of fiscal 2020, reported revenue and cost of revenue in our income statements for each quarter of fiscal 2020 would have been as follows:\\nQuarter Ended\\nYear Ended\\n(in millions) February 28 May 29 August 28 November 27 November 27\\nRevenue:\\nSubscription $ 2,732 $ 2,831 $ 2,948 $ 3,115 $ 11,626\\nProduct 143 128 109 127 507\\nServices and other 216 169 168 182 735\\nTotal revenue 3,091 3,128 3,225 3,424 12,868\\nCost of revenue:\\nSubscription 274 269 282 283 1,108\\nProduct 7 9 10 10 36\\nServices and other 171 137 135 135 578\\nTotal cost of revenue $ 452 $ 415 $ 427 $ 428 $ 1,722\\nCertain other immaterial prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\\nSignificant Accounting Policies\\nRevenue Recognition\\nOur revenue is derived from the sale of cloud-enabled software subscriptions, cloud-hosted offerings, term-based, royalty, and perpetual software licenses, associated software maintenance and support plans, consulting services, training and technical support. Most of our enterprise customer arrangements involve multiple promises to our customers.\\nRevenue is recognized when a contract exists between us and a customer and upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which may be capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations, or in the case of offerings such as cloud-enabled Creative Cloud and Document Cloud, accounted for as a single performance obligation. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.\\nSubscription, Product and Services Offerings\\nWe enter into revenue arrangements in which a customer may purchase a combination of cloud-enabled subscriptions, cloud-hosted offerings, term-based, royalty, and perpetual software licenses, associated software maintenance and support plans, consulting services, training and technical support.\\nADOBE INC.\\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\\n\\n•Operating expenses of $6.91 billion increased by $679 million, or 11%, during fiscal 2020, from $6.23 billion in fiscal 2019 primarily due to increases in base and incentive compensation and related benefits costs, as well as increased marketing spend. These increases were offset in part by decreases in travel-related expenses.\\n•Net income of $5.26 billion increased by $2.31 billion, or 78%, during fiscal 2020 from $2.95 billion in fiscal 2019 primarily due to increases in revenue and the non-recurring benefit from income taxes resulting from intra-entity transfers of certain intellectual property rights.\\n•Net cash flows from operations of $5.73 billion during fiscal 2020 increased by $1.31 billion, or 30%, from $4.42 billion during fiscal 2019 primarily due to higher net income adjusted for the net effect of non-cash items.\\nPresentation Changes\\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we moved our Advertising Cloud offerings from our Digital Experience segment into our new Publishing and Advertising segment, which combined our Advertising Cloud offerings with our previous Publishing segment. This realignment is consistent with how we manage our Digital Experience segment to better reflect the strategic shift related to Advertising Cloud and to align with our overall core value proposition of delivering on customer experience management.\\nFurther, we reclassified revenue and related cost of revenue of our Advertising Cloud offerings from subscription to services and other on our Consolidated Statements of Income.\\nFinancial information for all fiscal years presented has been updated to reflect these reclassifications. There were no other updates to disclosures included in our prior year report in relation to the reclassifications.\\nRevenue\\nOur financial results for fiscal 2020 and 2019 are presented in accordance with Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which was adopted under the modified retrospective method at the beginning of fiscal 2019.

We primarily recognize subscription revenue ratably over the term of agreements with our customers, beginning with commencement of service. Subscription revenue related to certain offerings, where fees are based on a number of transactions and invoicing is aligned to the pattern of performance, customer benefit and consumption, are recognized on a usage basis.\\nWe have the following reportable segments: Digital Media, Digital Experience, and Publishing and Advertising.

We primarily recognize\\nproduct revenue at the point in time the software is available to the customer, provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met.\\nServices and Other\\nOur services and other revenue is comprised primarily of fees related to consulting, training, maintenance and support and our advertising offerings. We typically sell our consulting contracts on a time-and-materials and fixed-fee basis. These revenues are recognized as the services are performed for time and materials contracts and on a relative performance basis for fixed-fee contracts. Training revenues are recognized as the services are performed. Our maintenance and support offerings, which entitle customers, partners and developers to receive desktop product upgrades and enhancements or technical support, depending on the offering, are generally recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement. Transaction-based advertising revenue is recognized on a usage basis as we satisfy the performance obligations to our customers.\\nSegments\\nIn fiscal 2020, we categorized our products into the following reportable segments:\\n•Digital Media-Our Digital Media segment provides tools and solutions that enable individuals, teams and enterprises to create, publish, promote and monetize their digital content anywhere.

Document Cloud ARR exiting fiscal 2020 was $1.46 billion, up from $1.08 billion at the end of fiscal 2019. Total Digital Media ARR grew to $10.18 billion at the end of fiscal 2020, up from $8.33 billion at the end of fiscal 2019. Revaluing our ending ARR for fiscal 2020 using currency rates at the beginning of fiscal 2021, our Digital Media ARR at the end of fiscal 2020 would be $10.26 billion or approximately $77 million higher than the ARR reported above.\\nOur success in driving growth in ARR has positively affected our revenue growth. Creative revenue in fiscal 2020 was $7.74 billion, up from $6.48 billion in fiscal 2019 and representing 19% year-over-year growth. Document Cloud revenue in fiscal 2020 was $1.50 billion, up from $1.22 billion in fiscal 2019 and representing 22% year-over-year revenue growth and reflecting an increase in demand driven by the shift to remote work as well as our continued efforts to transition Document Cloud to a subscription-based model. Total Digital Media segment revenue grew to $9.23 billion in fiscal 2020, up from $7.71 billion in fiscal 2019 and representing 20% year-over-year growth. These increases were driven by strong net new user growth, including those resulting from the current work-from-home environment reflecting expanded digital engagement.\\nDigital Experience\\nWe are a market leader in the fast-growing category addressed by our Digital Experience segment. The Adobe Experience Cloud applications, services and platform are designed to manage customer journeys, enable shoppable experiences and deliver intelligence for businesses of any size in any industry. Our differentiation and competitive advantage is strengthened by our ability to use the Adobe Experience Platform to connect our comprehensive set of solutions.\\nAdobe Experience Cloud is focused on delivering solutions for our enterprise customers across the following strategic growth pillars:\\n•Customer data and insights. Our solutions deliver real-time customer profiles and intelligence across the customer journey. Our offerings include Adobe Experience Platform, Adobe Analytics, Adobe Audience Manager, Customer Journey Analytics, Real-time Customer Data Platform and Intelligent Services.\\n•Content and commerce.

Our offerings include Adobe Experience Manager, Adobe Target and Adobe Commerce.\\n•Customer journey management.

By combining the creativity of our Digital Media business\\nwith the science of our Digital Experience business, we help our customers to more efficiently and effectively make, manage, measure and monetize their content across every channel with an end-to-end workflow and feedback loop.\\nWe utilize a direct sales force to market and license our Digital Experience solutions, as well as an extensive ecosystem of partners, including marketing agencies, systems integrators and independent software vendors that help license and deploy our solutions to their customers. We have made significant investments to broaden the scale and size of all of these routes to market, and our recent financial results reflect the success of these investments.\\nDigital Experience revenue for all fiscal years presented has been updated to reflect the Advertising Cloud segment move. Digital Experience revenue was $3.13 billion in fiscal 2020, up from $2.80 billion in fiscal 2019 which represents 12% year-over-year growth. Driving this increase was the increase in subscription revenue across our offerings which grew to $2.66 billion in fiscal 2020 from $2.28 billion in fiscal 2019, representing 17% year-over-year growth.\\nCOVID-19 UPDATE\\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a disease caused by a novel strain of the coronavirus (COVID-19) to be a pandemic. This pandemic has had widespread, rapidly-evolving and unpredictable impacts on global societies, economies, financial markets and business practices. Federal and state governments have implemented measures in an effort to contain the virus, including physical distancing, travel restrictions, border closures, limitations on public gatherings, work from home, supply chain logistical changes and closure of non-essential businesses. Our focus remains on promoting employee health and safety, serving our customers and ensuring business continuity. As a result, we have taken action to direct our teams to work from home, suspend travel and replace in-person events such as Adobe Summit and MAX, with digital events through July 2021.\\nDuring the pandemic, digital has become the primary way for people to connect, work, learn and be entertained, and for businesses to engage with customers. This macro trend towards all things digital has increased the importance and relevance of our solutions and accelerated the tailwinds that benefit our business, which contributed to our continued growth year over year. However, while our revenue and earnings are relatively predictable as a result of our subscription-based business model, the broader implications of the pandemic on our results of operations and overall financial performance remain uncertain. See Risk Factors for further discussion of the possible impact of the pandemic on our business.\\nFinancial Performance Summary for Fiscal 2020\\n•Total Digital Media ARR of approximately $10.18 billion as of November 27, 2020 increased by $1.85 billion, or 22%, from $8.33 billion as of November 29, 2019. The increase in our Digital Media ARR was primarily due to new user adoption of our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings.\\n•Creative revenue of $7.74 billion increased by $1.25 billion, or 19%, during fiscal 2020, from $6.48 billion in fiscal 2019. Document Cloud revenue of $1.50 billion increased by $272 million, or 22%, during fiscal 2020, from $1.22 billion in fiscal 2019. The increases were primarily due to subscription revenue growth associated with our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings.\\n•Digital Experience revenue of $3.13 billion increased by $330 million, or 12%, during fiscal 2020, from $2.80 billion in fiscal 2019. The increase was primarily due to subscription revenue growth across our offerings.\\n•Remaining performance obligation of $11.34 billion as of November 27, 2020 increased by $1.52 billion, or 15%, from $9.82 billion as of November 29, 2019, primarily due to new contracts and renewals for our Digital Media and Digital Experience offerings.\\n•Cost of revenue of $1.72 billion increased by $49 million, or 3%, during fiscal 2020, from $1.67 billion in fiscal 2019 primarily due to increases in hosting services and data center costs, offset in large part by decreases in Advertising Cloud media costs.\\n\\nADOBE INC.\\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\\nFully hosted subscription services (SaaS) allow customers to access hosted software during the contractual term without taking possession of the software. Cloud-hosted subscription services may be sold on a fee-per-subscription period basis or based on consumption or usage.\\nWe recognize revenue ratably over the contractual service term for hosted services that are priced based on a committed number of transactions where the delivery and consumption of the benefit of the services occur evenly over time, beginning on the date the services associated with the committed transactions are first made available to the customer and continuing through the end of the contractual service term. Over-usage fees and fees based on the actual number of transactions are billed in accordance with contract terms as these fees are incurred and are included in the transaction price of an arrangement as variable consideration. Fees based on a number of transactions, where invoicing is aligned to the pattern of performance, customer benefit and consumption, are typically accounted for utilizing the “as-invoiced” practical expedient. Revenue for subscriptions sold as a fee per period is recognized ratably over the contractual term as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit of the underlying service.\\nWhen cloud-enabled services are highly integrated and interrelated with on-premise software, such as in our cloud-enabled Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings, the individual components are not considered distinct and revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period for which the cloud-enabled services are provided.\\nThe subscription support plans related to those customer arrangements whose revenues we classify as subscription revenues represent stand-ready performance obligations. Revenue from these subscription support plans is recognized ratably over their respective contractual terms and classified as subscription revenue.\\nLicenses for on-premise software may be purchased on a perpetual basis, as a subscription for a fixed period of time or based on usage for certain of our OEM and royalty agreements. Revenue from distinct on-premise licenses is recognized at the point in time the software is available to the customer, provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met, and classified as product revenue on our Consolidated Statements of Income. Some of our enterprise license arrangements allow customers to commit non-cancellable funds. These non-cancellable committed funds are nonrefundable and provide our customers options to either renew monthly on-premise term-based licenses or use some or all funds to purchase other Adobe products or services. Revenue associated with these monthly term-based licenses and associated maintenance and support is classified as subscription revenue.\\nOur services and other revenue is comprised primarily of fees related to consulting, training, maintenance and support and our advertising offerings. We typically sell our consulting contracts on a time-and-materials and fixed-fee basis. These revenues are recognized as the services are performed for time and materials contracts and on a relative performance basis for fixed-fee contracts. Training revenues are recognized as the services are performed. Our maintenance and support offerings, which entitle customers, partners and developers to receive desktop product upgrades and enhancements or technical support, depending on the offering, are generally recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement. Our transaction-based advertising offerings, where fees are based on a number of impressions per month and invoicing is aligned to the pattern of performance, customer benefit and consumption, are typically accounted for utilizing the “as-invoiced” practical expedient.\\nWe exclude from the transaction price sales and other taxes collected from customers on behalf of the relevant government authority. Most of our products are delivered electronically, however in instances where shipping and handling costs are incurred, we treat these amounts as costs to fulfill the contract and they are not considered a performance obligation and the associated fees are not included in the transaction price.\\nJudgments\\nOur contracts with customers may include multiple goods and services. For example, some of our offerings include both on-premise and/or on-device software licenses and cloud services. Determining whether the software licenses and the cloud services are distinct from each other, and therefore performance obligations to be accounted for separately, or not distinct from each other, and therefore part of a single performance obligation, may require significant judgment. We have concluded that the on-premise/on-device software licenses and cloud services provided in our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud subscription offerings are not distinct from each other such that revenue from each offering should be recognized ratably over the subscription period for which the cloud services are provided. In reaching this conclusion, we considered the nature of our promise to Creative Cloud and Document Cloud customers, which is to provide a complete end-to-end creative design or\\nADOBE INC.\\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\\ndocument workflow solution that operates seamlessly across multiple devices and teams. We fulfill this promise by providing access to a solution that integrates cloud-based and on-premise/on-device features that, together through their integration, provide functionalities, utility and workflow efficiencies that could not be obtained from either the on-premise/on-device software or cloud services on their own.\\nCloud-based features that are integral to our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings and that work together with the on-premise/on-device software include, but are not limited to: Creative Cloud Libraries, which enable customers to access their work, settings, preferences and other assets seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices and collaborate across teams in real time; shared reviews which enable simultaneous editing and commenting of PDFs across desktop, mobile and web; automatic cloud rendering of a design which enables it to be worked on in multiple mediums; and Sensei, Adobe’s cloud-hosted artificial intelligence and machine learning framework, which enables features such as automated photo-editing, photograph content-awareness, natural language processing, optical character recognition and automated document tagging.\\nStandalone selling price is established by maximizing the amount of observable inputs, primarily actual historical selling prices for performance obligations where available, and includes consideration of factors such as go-to-market model and geography. Individual products may have multiple values for standalone selling price depending on factors such as where they are sold and what channel they are sold through. Where standalone selling price may not be directly observable (e.g., the performance obligation is not sold separately), we maximize the use of observable inputs by using information that may include reviewing pricing practices, performance obligations with similar customers and selling models.\\nHuman: What is Adobe's main revenue??\"\n",

    "### What is an AI agent ?\n",
    "An agentic employs a chain-of-thought reasoning process, where the LLM is prompted to think gradually through a question, interleaving its reasoning with the ability to use external tools such as search engines and APIs. This allows the LLM to retrieve relevant information that can help answer partial aspects of the question, ultimately leading to a more comprehensive and accurate final response. This approach is inspired by the \"Reason and Act\" (ReAct) design introduced in the paper [ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.03629)  which aims to synergize the reasoning capabilities of language models with the ability to interact with external resources and take actions. By combining these two facets, an agentic LLM assistant can provide more informed and well-rounded answers to complex user queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "![agent components](./static/agent-components.png)\n",

    "### Why build an AI agent?\n",
    "In today's digital landscape, enterprises are inundated with a vast array of data sources, ranging from traditional PDF documents to complex SQL and NoSQL databases, and everything in between. While this wealth of information holds immense potential for gaining valuable insights and driving operational efficiency, the sheer volume and diversity of data can often pose significant challenges in terms of accessibility and utilization.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the power of agentic LLM assistants comes into play. By leveraging progress in LLM design patterns such as Reason and Act (ReAct) and other traditional or novel design patterns, these intelligent assistants are capable of integrating with an enterprise's diverse data sources. Through the development of specialized tools tailored to each data source and the ability of LLM agents to identify the right tool for a given question, agentic LLM assistants can simplify how you navigate and extract relevant information, regardless of its origin or structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "This enables a rich, multi-source conversation that promises to unlock the full potential of the entreprise data, enabling data-driven decision-making, enhancing operational efficiency, and ultimately driving productivity and growth.\n",
